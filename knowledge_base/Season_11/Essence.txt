We are very eager to read Bhagavad Gita. Arjuna is being given this nectar. Gopala is milking the cows.
So how can I also relish that same nectar which Arjuna is enjoying?
So it is told the qualification is Partho Vatsa Sudhir Bhokta.
Dhir means a person who is very sober. What do we mean when we say a person is sober? That person is
always very tranquil. He doesn't get agitated. He doesn't get carried away by so-called material
success. He is not disturbed by material loss. He is not elated on birth. He does not lament on death.
Such a person is called Dheera. Sudheera, a person who is extremely sober. Such sober
people can understand this Bhagavad Gita. So that is why to bring a person to sober platform,
so many rules and regulations are mentioned in the Vedas. Now people get disturbed very very easily.
So if a person follows the rules and regulations mentioned in the Vanashrama Dharma,
then the entire society is very very peaceful. And only a person who is very peaceful, he
understands that I am not the body. So by bodily changes I should not get disturbed. Such a person
can begin to understand this knowledge of Bhagavad Gita. So this Bhagavad Gita itself is the essence.
All the Upanishads are cows which are giving milk of Bhagavad Gita. And now what is the essence of
that Bhagavad Gita? So that Lord Krishna is mentioning now. Srila Prabhupada explains this
verse can be taken as the essence. But why do we need this essence? Why do we need the cow and all
such things? So Srila Prabhupada, as you know, he explains many many places.
So His Grace Amit Asam Prabhu was explaining to us in the morning today in very nice Bhagavatam class
that everybody in this material world
is undergoing same process and same suffering. But some people they are suffering in poor
conditions, some people they are suffering in rich conditions. But in the absence of such
spiritual knowledge, people think suffering in rich condition that is very good standard of life.
Suppose a person comes and tells us that I am going to take your life away.
Some criminal he has caught us. Now he has told I have I will come and I will kill you any day.
So what shall be our response? We'll work very hard. Oh, this person will come and kill me any day.
So let me work hard and anyway death has to happen. So let me die very nicely. Let me have a good big
house for myself and in very posh locality of a very nice house. So let me die very nicely.
Good city in India or maybe abroad and then have a very nice car or a fleet of cars
and have name and fame and then let this person come and kill me.
Now before I attain these things he can come and kill me or after I attain he can come and kill me.
Will any sane person think like that? Not at all. So if any person comes and tells us
any day next moment next day or next year or any time but death is sure I will come and kill you
that is for sure I will come without any notice. So will a person work very hard for
dying in rich conditions or so-called successful conditions? Not at all.
And if the same person is coming and giving you food and something to eat
shall we be able to accept that food from the hands of the killer?
But that is what is happening with all the living entities in this material world.
That is why Yudhishthir Maharaj told when he was asked by the Yaksha what is the
most wonderful thing in this world. So Yudhishthir Maharaj told
So this is a very important point to understand which living entities do not know.
Ahani means day. Ahani means day after day.
It means day after day. Yam means Yamraj the lord of death and living entities are going to his
abode they are succumbing to death day after day but those who are left behind they think I will
never die I will always be here and they work very hard and take so much of tension to die simply
in rich conditions. So one of our devotees was telling us when he got some severe issue
so and some devotee he was
caring very nicely for the devotees who took good care that Prabhu should have nice treatment
and he was given the best facility in a very good multi-specialty hospital. So Prabhu was
explaining his and he underwent an immediate operation so he was telling that they took me
to hospitals and that place was so nice my private ward because you know usually very the most
richest people and such businessmen can afford such things and we live in humble conditions so
that was very opulent but he told it was not at all pleasant at that time when we were in hospitals.
So when suffering is there when death is there when disease is there it will not matter that I'm
suffering in a very big palatial house or I'm suffering ordinarily. So Prabhu explained another
beautiful thing how we can see we want to become very rich very successful most rich and
and we can see that the lady who got opportunity to become member of the royal family
and she is explaining now to the whole world that I was thinking of dying there
I was thinking of living my life committing suicide and so much harassment I faced over there
and that person prince he has given up his royal order and he's trying to pass time as
an ordinary person so we want to somehow enter into the royal order or the rich order
and the people there they are also not satisfied extremely dissatisfied this is the nature of this
material world when suffering comes it does not matter what is your surrounding so simply changing
the surrounding is not a very sane activity especially when death is sure so that is why
this is the first knowledge of Bhagavad Gita Bhagavad Gita tells you
aham brahmasmi iron spirit soul my real life is different how long will you keep on sleeping
and dreaming in this temporary state of affairs accepting a temporary body so wake up you are
eternal so you have got Varan you have got a very great boon in this human form of life
intelligence is sharp enough to understand the spiritual knowledge the mystery of spiritual
knowledge understand how you have already an eternal life and everything simply we have
forgotten and we are dreaming in this temporary world and whatever you may wish to attain in this
world that is simply suffering in different circumstances suffering is same so the real
problem of life is Janma Mrityu Jara Vyadi Dukh Doshanu Darshanam Krishna explains in 13th chapter
the real problem is death the real problem is disease physical mental so many diseases are
there so earlier only physical diseases were there now by our increased knowledge people
are getting mental harassment and people are becoming mentally sick it is very difficult to
find any person in society who has not faced depression now so mental sickness is a norm
so disease death old age these are the real problems of life
and a person who is sane he will try to make a solution of these problems that is Vedic civilization
do not die move towards immortality that is the aim of human form of life
and how do we do this that is done simply by understanding the science of god lord
krishna has explained previously Janma Karmachami Divyam Avam Yoveti Tatvata in four chapter
my birth activities they are transcendental one who can understand the mystery of my activities
my birth so we are very fond of studying so much of science how living entity is taking birth what
is taking birth what are these genes dna rna and all such things so we are very nicely
scientifically trying to understand how human beings animals creepers plants trees they are
taking birth we are very much interested in such sciences but these things are not going to solve
the problems of life how much ever you analyze death disease old age will continue but if we
try to understand the science of appearance birth of god the activities of god then a person will
get will attain liberated platform so this is the first instruction that we have to assimilate in
our life so who can understand the activities of god so lord krishna has very beautifully explained
that only a devotee can know me no other person can know this so i'll share on the screen the
previous words which we discussed
so so many people we find today who because of lack of sufficient knowledge
they are giving their own process but we have to understand god bhagavad gita he it is spoken by
god krishna himself it is the most authorized book of knowledge of yoga yoga shastra the best
yoga shastra so here what krishna is mentioning that is very very clear so lord krishna explained
we were seeing the virat roop explanation universal form and krishna explains this form is very very
rare very difficult to see only out of my mercy i have shown you and some others also have shown
who are awakened in spiritual vision and then lord krishna mentioned we saw in the previous
session so so this virat roop in which you saw entire universe including past present and future
that is very rare to be seen however the most difficult form to see is the two-handed form
which krishna showed 5000 years ago when he appeared became visible on this planet
so somebody asked very interesting question i later read all the questions in the chats i try to cover
all of them so it was very relevant and i was anyway going to cover which we are doing now
so very intelligent question anybody should think about it that lord krishna is telling this
two-handed form is most confidential it is most difficult to see and that universal form
it is less difficult to see you can follow other process you can be expert in vedas you can be a
great tapasvi or doing other things by adding little devotion you can see that form however
this two-handed form it is most difficult even here you can see in the third line deva api asya
roop asya nityam darshana kanksina deva the topmost devatas brahma shiva nityam kanksina they are
also always eager to see this form how do we understand this universal form on the battlefield
nobody could see except arjuna and sanjay was seeing and some other devotees but from different
other planets people were perceiving others were not understanding why arjuna is bewildered what
he's seeing what is happening between these two people on the chariot and this two-handed form
everybody's seeing crores of people were there assembled on either sides to fight kauravas and
pandavas and two-handed form everybody's seeing so how is it possible that two-handed form is
more difficult to see than the four-handed form or than the universal form how do we understand this
can anybody comment can anybody explain
let me see who has been very regular and understanding the classes nicely
we have to okay we satyam prabhu is telling we have to see by the mercy of a pure devotee
amit is telling two-handed form can be seen by heart
special eye no all of them were seeing two-handed form by these eyes with their eyes everybody was
seeing when krishna came on this planet everybody saw him for normal vision krishna is covered by
his internal potency yog maya we have only by pure devotion it's possible to see
prabhu this is basically all about understanding the main thing is to understand krishna
yes not understand but seeing krishna is talking about seen
we have to have rasa like vrajavasis pure rasas like vrajavasis pure love they didn't care if
he was powerful but others also who are not having that affection they are also seeing the two-handed
form of krishna why krishna is telling it is difficult everybody seeing krishna in two-handed
form when he came here but universal form they were not seeing gopis loved that is okay one may
love and not love but why krishna is telling this is confidential only they've devatas also are eager
to see we can see but no one will understand and accept that he's supreme personality harita mataji
claps i request all of you can clap for her i also clap for you very nice answer
others also are very close many many answers have come thank you so much now let us discuss
thank you for your answers so how do we understand that two-handed form which everybody on the planet
is seeing is most difficult to see so that is why we have two activities of god are
uh very scientific and thus krishna is telling one who understands this science he will get
liberated means they don't follow material laws they are transcendental so what is the
meaning that this form is difficult to behold so when if you have read bhagavatam or krishna book
it is explained very beautifully when krishna was entering the wrestling arena where kansa plotted
to kill krishna so different people were able were perceiving krishna differently
and similarly the shloka is also there which we discussed a couple of weeks ago
so
very important shloka mentioned in 10th canto it is explaining
it
so this personality is uh taken as brahma jyoti by some so if you try to see the sun directly
when the sun is overhead you may not be able to see the form of the sun but simply very bright
effulgence so some sages very great exalted sages who are very well versed in study of the vedas and
upanishads brahma jyanis they are able to just see the light coming out of krishna's body god's
body and they misassume that god is simply light god does not have a form just like a person may
not be able to see the form of sun when the sun is very bright it is shining overhead
it
so they take him to be as brahma jyoti some other people are there who are more advanced
who are engaged in service of krishna and they take krishna as supreme personality of god
as supreme god when they see him they understand oh here is supreme god
there are other people who have taken shelter of maya material energy what is the meaning of
taking shelter so the soul there are different categories of energies of krishna so one
category is all of us living entities technically called jiva tatva and we are called tatasth shakti
means marginal potency we can either remain under control of spiritual energy of krishna or in
control of material energy just like some living entities we are called tatasth shakti
of material energy just like some living entities are controlled in jail some are free outside but
both are under control of government so similarly now we are like criminals and we have
got ourselves trapped in this material energy so material energy is controlling us it forces
us to feel hunger thirst fatigue old age death and hunger and physical mental stress and all
such things we are forced to chase after sense objects which never satisfy us even if we attain
them these are all the harassment induced by material forces even if i want i cannot i cannot
but chase the objects of my senses my senses force us so there is great harassment so because of the
demand of these senses people are put to a lot of hard work you work hard day and night entire life
because i cannot control my senses so this is called taking shelter of material energy just
like in jail person is put to hard work he's forced to break the stones and other things
other living entities have taken shelter of spiritual energy means they completely obey the
instructions of krishna and they are controlled by yoga maya not by durga devi of this world
and there there is no death there is no disease there is no old age there is no fatigue
and there is complete enjoyment every step
so those people who have taken shelter of material energy means those who are living
in this material universe they are called maya so those who are in this material world
conditioned by this body thinking i am this body as we hallucinate i am the body of dream so those
who are such under such hallucination i'm man woman cat dog indian american hindu muslim like that
such people they perceive krishna as maya they perceive krishna as ordinary human being
so the same person is perceived differently so thus even when krishna came people were not able to
appreciate see his spiritual form and appreciate that he is even supreme personality of godhead
very handful of people were knowing that krishna is supreme personality of godhead
kunti devi pandavas with or some other very handful of devotees
so first of all people are maya shaitanam those who are thinking that i am the body
they even if god comes and stands in front of us we will think that he is ordinary human being
just like a colorblind person even though he's seeing brown he will mistake brown as green or
something else he's not actually seeing the color just like a sick man if he tastes food he's not
actually tasting food the food tastes bitter to that person so although he's tasting but he's not
tasting in a similar fashion all the people are seeing 200 form of krishna but they are not
actually seeing 200 form they are not able to appreciate the spiritual vision of that 200 form
and they mistake krishna as an ordinary human being so just like a sick man can never appreciate
can never taste food although he puts it on the tongue and gets a different perverted bitter taste
in a similar fashion we get perverted vision of god you go to the temple it is not stone it is
krishna personally standing there who appears like a stone like a statue like wood
similarly when we chant the name of krishna haray krishna haray krishna krishna krishna
this is personally krishna but when the living entity is in bodily concept of life we will not
be able to realize this is krishna just like a sick man does not realize so does this 200 form
even though it was present but people could not understand that this is spiritual form
understand that this is spiritual form
so that is why bhakti siddhanta maharaj tells one should not be very eager to see krishna behind
a bush in vrindavan just like you go to vrindavan some people to create hype for the tourists they
tell oh this is the one in the evening krishna dances here and those who see they become blind
so krishna is not like you know some performer you can simply sneak into the auditorium and
you can see him performing no krishna is seated in the heart first krishna sees then we see his
sanctions are seeing his sanctions how much we have to see first he sees and then we see
so nobody can just cheat krishna into seeing him observing him so and even if you see you will not
be able to appreciate unless you are having a spiritual vision your body senses are spiritualized
thus it is told this 200 form is most confidential
even though it is there in front you will not be able to appreciate
so thus this is the science of krishna consciousness so what happens when a person
is actually able to see krishna actually able to hear krishna so simply what to speak of
hearing krishna's name or seeing krishna even glimpse of that vision it destroys all the past
becomes liberated and he becomes nothing in the world disturbs a person even a person who gets
the glimpse of the form of krishna the light which is emanating from krishna's body
spiritual light if a person is able to see he becomes liberated nothing can disturb that
person then when a person advances further he is able to see krishna and when he sees krishna
what happens like some people you know they tell there could be psychological issue or sentiment
that i see krishna i saw krishna standing there in my house or in the temple or in dream
but actually if we see krishna then there a person will not be under control of material energy
a person's experience of the world will change completely and he will be completely in ecstasy
devoid of all desires in the heart through maraj wanted to become greater than brahma
and he engaged in tapasya but when he actually saw krishna within his heart
then all his desires vanished and when krishna personally appeared outside
face to face he was able to see just like we can see each other he was able to see krishna face
to face so krishna's what do you want you want kingdom we told no no i do not want anything
swamin
has chance to get a position higher than the controller of universe
but he's denying that position position such is the pleasure when a person simply sees krishna
so this is the pleasure which are living entities actually hankering for
much much higher than all these material aspirations and that is what is expressed
by all the devotees anybody who is able to see krishna he's able to actually hear the name of
krishna who is able to appreciate krishna's presence he has no desires in his heart he's
completely full and satisfied in his life so this is the mystery thus two-handed form is most
confidential and as lord krishna mentioned in the next verse
so this is the mystery so let me read bhagavad-gita vedas very nicely and let me understand and see krishna in this way so krishna tells
by vedas you cannot see this form so let me do tapasya as rishis have done let me go to himalayas
let me not eat no tapasya no by tapasya also you cannot do this so okay i have to give charity also
before i start tapasya i will give away all my wealth whatever i obtained and i will live in
jungle by charity also you cannot do that okay so i have to worship krishna so thus this verse
tells so there is maya shritanam those who have taken shelter of maya there are other higher sages
who have not taken shelter of maya they are liberated but they are able to just see the
effulgence of krishna now there are there is a another category who are worshipping krishna
with awe and reverence and they understand that krishna is supreme personality of godhead
but such people also cannot understand that there is a class of devotees
after many many many lives of executing pious activities spiritual activities
a position can be attained in which you can play with krishna you can ride on shoulders of krishna
krishna can ride on your shoulders and that is the position of the gopas the friends of krishna
so this position even those people who know that krishna is supreme personality of godhead
they also cannot understand that there is a class of most advanced spiritualists who forget
that krishna is supreme god and thus they deal with him as an ordinary man and such kind of
spiritual life is the culmination of all the knowledge mentioned in the vedas is culmination
of all the tapasya that a person can do is culmination of all charity that a person can
do all worship one can do but by official worship as many people go to temple they worship
for various reasons a person cannot attain this by official worship a person cannot do this by
doing any charity so does it mean we should not do these things that people can misunderstand
that is why in the next verse sheila pravopada immediately makes it clear
so krishna mentions here in the next verse then how one can see this form of god by which one can
become immortal one can attain unlimited ecstasy which cannot be done by vedas dan tapasya or
worship also so krishna has mentioned here verse number 54 very important so all those people who
tell by following gyan marga by reading the upanishads and vedas you can attain spiritual
perfection all those people who tell you do tapasya you do meditation xyz you can attain
perfection and all those people who tell who do charity some other ritualistic activity or xyz
you can attain perfection please show them this verse of bhagavad gita verse number 54 text 11
krishna tells but but means this thing is very significant but there is one way of seeing my
this form and the only way is as i am there as it is arjun you can perceive me only by
two ananya shakya gapum drishtam chatat vena that vena means in fact as it is scientifically in
truth so everybody's seeing krishna but they are not able to actually see the spiritual form of
krishna just like a scientist when he sees pencil entering into water he understands pencil has not
been this is mirage this is called actual seeing when a scientist sees water in the desert he
understands it is total internal reflection this is called actual seeing so if you actually want
to see krishna sorry if you want to know krishna you want to see krishna scientifically then it
is only possible by bhakti it is only possible by unalloyed devotional service my dear arjuna
only by undivided devotional service can i be understood as i am standing before you and thus
can be seen directly only in this way you can enter into the mysteries of my understanding
only by undivided devotional service so what is called ananya bhakti bhakti can be done for
various reasons usually people take to bhakti worship of krishna for material benefits that
let me have a good job let me have material comforts or some success in my life material
success or let me have liberation or let me have some siddhis and powers all these things can be
very easily and swiftly attained by krishna bhakti and these things krishna gives very easily
however the topmost thing you will not be able to attain
so that is why if you want to attain the highest perfection of seeing god face to face unlimited
happiness then ananya bhakti should be done so i do not want to chant because i become very peaceful
i don't want to meditate on this holy name for my personal uh mental gratification oh by this
chanting my mind becomes very peaceful yes that is a side effect that will follow automatically
my focus concentration increases yes all these things are side effects that will happen my day
goes very nicely if i do this thing yes all these things are side effect but the ambition should be
just for the pleasure of krishna i am executing if i'm hearing lecture it should not be for my
intellectual gratification it should be simply to praise my spiritual master and krishna
thus we understood how that illiterate person brahmana he was illiterate but his spiritual
master told him you read bhagavad gita every day and he was trying to read bhagavad gita for the
pleasure of his spiritual master and thus he understood bhagavad gita he attained spiritual
perfection even without being able to read anything simply because he was trying to do
uh what his spiritual master told so thus pleasure of guru and krishna this should be the
aim behind all spiritual activities this is called ananya bhakti not for any siddhi all the siddhis
power that you can conceive of as some people people were asking can chanting not destroy
corona it can destroy it has destroyed in the past also uh and but it should not be employed
for that purpose it is like using sandalwood as firewood sandalwood is very costly it has got
higher purpose so do not use sandalwood as firewood do not use currency notes to as fuel to make your
tea in the kitchen they have got higher value so in a similar fashion although bhakti could be
used to attain anything any powers liberation or xyz it should not be used for that that should
be executed only for the pleasure of guru and krishna so when a person executes bhakti in such
a manner then he can scientifically understand see god and hear god's name so how to practically do
it so thus pravopada understanding the mind of the devotees then devotees may not care about
tapasya may not care about reading vedas and other things very beautifully explains in the purport
that no these things are important by executing these things only you will rise to platform of
ananya bhakti so it is just like telling simply 12th standard will not fetch you uh
uh a job so for doing that you have to have a graduate giving typical example of course
scenario is changing now but typically you have to have degree then people will employ you then
companies would hire you so if you have to have a job 12th standard will not help you your schooling
will not help you but it does not mean that we don't go to school at all school is important to
do graduation eventually get a get a job which is the aim similarly reading vedas is very important
doing tapasya is important so that is why getting up in brahmohurta taking cold water bath
and not breaking four regulative principles meat-eating intoxication gambling illicit sex is
important for fasting on ekadashi other days of appearance of krishna disappearance of acharyas
is important charity is very important and but how it should be executed for the sake of krishna
vedas which give knowledge of krishna bhagavatam bhagavad gita should be read
tapasya for pleasing krishna charity uh for uh furthering krishna's mission spreading this
knowledge of bhagavad gita and worship of krishna it is very much required but these things should
be done under the personal guidance of spiritual master personal coaching is required that is very
beautifully explained in the purport for executing anything nicely in material world you need coaching
then it is much more required for spiritual life so only a person who is on this platform of
ananya bhakti under his guidance a person can learn the science of the most advanced form
of spiritual life ananya bhakti so how that has to happen practically that krishna has mentioned
here in the last verse of this chapter and this verse is taken as the essence of bhagavad gita
so five activities are mentioned here in this verse which are those activities now how to do
this bhakti should i simply think about krishna cry about krishna run in wilderness shouting krishna
what am i supposed to do to execute this ananya bhakti am i supposed to go to jungle vrindavan
or puri or somewhere so very beautifully practically krishna tells how we can do this
so we have to do some activity so here lord krishna is mentioning my dear arjuna which kind of activity
you should do one who is engaged in my pure devotional service free from the contamination
of previous activities and from mental speculation who is friendly to every living entity certainly
comes to me madhkarma kriyan madhparamo madhbhakta sanghvarjitaha nirvaira sarva bhuteshu yassa maameti
so first of all activity is required we are controlled by different modes
just like a pig is forced to run after stool that is tamasic activity crow is forced to
run after filthy things so similarly human beings also have different inclinations
man body runs after woman body woman body runs after man body child body runs after mud
old body xyz so we have got different inclinations bodies are forcing us here in this world to do
certain activities now this krishna consciousness is so beautiful krishna is telling do that
activity for my pleasure it is very simple so even though you do not realize you are not the
body does not matter you feel hungry you want to eat so offer food to krishna and then you eat that
is called krishna karma madhkarma krishna anyway you have to cook food do not think oh let me cook
this thing nicely and i will enjoy this taste no madhkarma kriyan arjuna was a fighter before
he heard bhagavad gita he was fighter after he heard bhagavad gita what is the difference
so the difference is that of consciousness it is very simple
a soldier is killing so a soldier can kill out of his personal grudge then he will be court-martialed
he will lose his job
so soldier can be i'm sorry there is some disturbance so just see the small living entity
are there some small insects they cannot understand krishna consciousness it has to wait for many
many births now in human form we have got this opportunity so we should not miss so activity has
to be done nature will force us to cook something to eat something so madhkarma kriyan it is very
scientific simply we have to do the work for krishna's pleasure so cook for krishna and eat
something which is offered to krishna that's it now i have got inclination of businessmen now what
do i do do i have to leave my business to attain perfection of krishna consciousness spiritual life
no need not leave business you can do perfect business but for the pleasure of krishna
if i think let me suffer in rich circumstances that is foolishness as we have discussed in the
beginning there is a great misconception from which people are suffering accumulation of
resources name fame people will satisfy us it does not satisfy anybody neither the royal orders
businessmen those who are job or those who are jobless so we should not try to fruitlessly change
the material conditions just keep your body and soul together and work should be done for
satisfaction of krishna and we should have just simple life simple living high thinking this is
vedic culture and people were so simple they would agree to live even in jungles and use all energy
for krishna's satisfaction so this is the first thing which we should understand madhkarma kriyan
we can do whatever job business or other activity or even clean the street if we have got a lot of
money that money belongs to krishna because this body mind has been provided by krishna
so it should be used for making nice temple for krishna publishing distributing nice books for
krishna but if somebody is not so rich not so wealthy i cannot construct temple for krishna
does not matter you have no wealth then in that temple you go and clean the floor of temple
so equal result can be attained what a person has attained by building temple for krishna
you can attain the same result by cleaning the floor of krishna's temple so krishna simply
sees whatever he is having he realizes this belongs to me and he uses in my service this is
called madhkarma kriyan all the resources should be employed in krishna's service then madhparamo
so now i am engaged in service of krishna that is very nice but
i want some personal commission out of it i am engaged in krishna service for my satisfaction
as we discussed for my peace of mind or krishna will give good wealth to me yes krishna can do
that and krishna will do that easily but then highest result will not be given by krishna
so madhparamo the result what i want to attain from all these activities
nothing but getting association of krishna so there are various pleasures in this world
but when we get the association of the people we love that is the highest pleasure even which a
person can get in material life but that love is not real love because everyone is ultimately
self-interested we are not satisfied but it is that loving pleasure which is greatest
without which all success is of no value so having that association of krishna that is the highest
goal which should be of all the krishna conscious activities so i should not engage in service of
krishna for any personal benefit any material amelioration any material effect but only to
attain association of krishna either in the planet of krishna or those devotees who are very
advanced they are not afraid they can go anywhere wherever krishna wants they can go there and
engage in krishna service so when i am engaged in krishna service many devotees ask prabhu how to
chant holy name nicely how to feel presence of krishna we are telling that it is krishna only
how to see that krishna is there in the temple yes for this madh karma kin madh parama it is
important so when we are working very hard just for the satisfaction of krishna krishna will make
his presence felt you know just like when the ceo sees oh this person nice new person he is
doing very nice thing then he personally calls him he personally gives him he rewards him
and he engages in his confidential departments he becomes very pleased then he can see him personally
and the ordinary person tells i want to meet him the top person unless you have done something
significant you cannot see so when krishna so that is why we have to work in such a way that
krishna agrees to see us so we cannot just force ourselves upon krishna oh i have got hold of
krishna's lotus feet i can touch krishna we can never do that when krishna is pleased by our
service madh karma krishna karma and which is done only to satisfy krishna madh parama just to have
his association we are doing that then krishna reveals himself and madh bhakta a person should
engage himself in nine kinds of devotional service what is the meaning of bhakta bhakta people think
sometimes because of especially in our country india if i can cry hearing bhagavata katha or
doing this thing that is bhakti or something weird concept they have think of krishna a little or
like that no so bhakti is done in nine ways shravanam kirtanam vishnu ho smaranam padasevanam
archanam vandanam dasyam shravanam hear about krishna simply keep on hearing about krishna life
will become perfect or kirtanam you explain this thing just like i am doing kirtanam here and you
all are doing shravanam i also am doing shravanam i am doing both kirtanam and shravanam but all of
you are doing just shravanam so simply if you keep on doing shravanam you can become successful
and if you are advanced you will like to also to do kirtan to explain this knowledge to others
so chanting the names of krishna singing the names of krishna or explaining the knowledge
science of krishna that is called kirtanam then smaranam then by hearing and explaining
when you understand krishna reveals his mystery you become attached to krishna and then you are
always thinking about krishna or gradually more and more you think of krishna that is called
smaranam thinking about krishna that is third level that is very advanced level
and after this shravanam kirtanam vishnu smaranam padasevanam you can serve the lotus feet of
krishna in the temple archanam you can worship the deity of krishna that needs very high
qualification not everybody can do that but it is also one element of devotional service deity worship
then vandanam offering prayers to krishna many prayers are mentioned in the scriptures like we
saw in this chapter prayers of arjuna so when you get time go in front of krishna and recite
these prayers vandanam this is another element dasyam krishna as orders the order specifically
is to explain this knowledge to others distribute such things so that people can come out of all
the misery carrying out his orders like the squirrel did all the monkey soldiers of lord
ramchandra did they carried out order simply carry out the order and your life becomes successful
or like arjuna act as friend of krishna or like bali maharaj whatever property you have everything
you offer to krishna completely that is called atmanivedanam including yourself i am completely
surrendered this is also an element either by executing one of these things two three or all
nine of them a person can make his life perfect so we will do some activities nature will force
us to do we should do it for krishna with the aim that krishna should be the goal and a person
should engage in these nine ways of executing devotional service and very important is sangh
varjitaha sangh varjita means association of non-devotees should be avoided it is very very
contaminating there are two kinds of sanghas just like now anybody who has got covered oh we maintain
distance they are isolated quarantined kept away in a similar fashion it is told there are two
kinds of kusangas wrong association one is fruitive worker jnana karmadi anavritham karmi and jnani
those people who are working very hard so that they can attain some material results either
gross money property etc or subtle name fame power etc but any kind of material result
they are actually mad they don't understand are not able to understand we are not the body
we are eternal so this madness is very very highly infecting like any other virus
and we will get contaminated in their association another category is speculators they simply want
to think oh what is life what is god so can an ant in a corner speculate what is quantum mechanics
what is trigonometry ant is very small having a small brain it can search out its sugar and
know how to mate and make some residence in the mud but its knowledge cannot reach the knowledge
of human beings similarly we can never sit in on an armchair and think about god and what is
who is the person who has manufactured so many universes we cannot do that
but some people who speculate like that they will create so many unnecessary confusions and
complication doubts in our mind and then the person is always confused in life not able to
understand krishna consciousness so their association should be avoided those people
who are after material enjoyment or mental speculation without reading krishna's instruction
directly they want to understand so such association material enjoys and mental
speculators their association should be avoided in other words krishna is telling live in
association of devotees or if you are very very advanced you can do nirjan bhajan also you can
sit alone like haridas thakur in den in mountain an entire day and night 24 hours bodily demands
will not disturb you you will not feel like eating sleeping you will continue your bhajan
that is very advanced stage so but easy ways because we are social beings now we need some
association we need society we need friends have that with devotees now there are by pravapa's
miracle thousands and lakhs of devotees who are executing this krishna consciousness we can live
with them and nirvaira sarvabhuteshu vaira means enemy nirvaira means friend a person should act
as friend of all living entities now what is the meaning of friend friend means who does good for
other friend he is willing to sacrifice even his life for other friend he is a real friend he's
always ready for help so what is the biggest help that can be done for living entities you give them
food shelter clothing education or actually now the friends are not friends now everybody's enemy
who are not in knowledge of krishna consciousness because everybody is engaging their friends or
family members in material activity oh you become very famous you make us proud or you go there
have this attainment have this goal what is the use of any temporary goal when death is certain
and you can solve death in this life by using these principles so actually these people are
vera although they are in the form of family members or neighbors or friends or well-wishers
although their heart may be good they want to do good but without knowledge you will do bad
just like the husband killed his wife by giving painkillers as we discussed so just heart is not
enough knowledge is knowledge is required so that is why any person who distributes this knowledge
he is actually nirvaira he is friend of the living entity so very rigorously a person should try to
realize this knowledge and spread this knowledge to others by distributing all that is why krishna
tells such a person is most dear to me who spreads this knowledge to others
all others are simply complicating their lives and any person who has done like this who
sacrifices his life pravapada explains best example is jesus christ he sacrifices life
so that others can become god conscious or so many other messengers have been there haridas
thakur a typical example is and like that they sacrifice their life simply for others who are
not even caring for their instructions but krishna is very much pleased by this so krishna tells
yes sama methi pandavas such people definitely they come to me so thus krishna has given this
is the essence of bhagavad gita it is very simple so many complications dhyana yoga raj yoga karma
yoga other things have been explained but this is the crux we have to do activities for the pleasure
of krishna understanding krishna is god if i please any other person they are also suffering
in life they will die how they can help but if krishna is pleased then my life is successful
so all the activities for krishna the aim of life should be to attain association of krishna just
like we are seeing each other face to face i desire to similarly associate with krishna
and engage in nine kinds of devotional service by this we can execute this
matparama and sangh varjita beware of association of mad people who are
are running after temporary benefits of life or mental speculators
live in the association of devotees and nirvaira try to act for the welfare of all the living
entities take out whatever time resources we can for the for furthering this mission of spreading
krishna consciousness and then krishna tells yes sama methi pandava i take care even if he's not
able to think of me at the time of death i will take care all the material laws he will surpass
and he will come to me so with this we finish our 11th chapter of bhagavad gita
