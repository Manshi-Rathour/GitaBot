So I remember when I took admission college and first few classes they are spent as orientation
the professors they interact with us.
So one of the professors he was discussing a few things where are you from what was your
rank and what are your hobbies do you have any questions and I raise the hand yes sir
I have a question yes what do you want to ask so I ask is there any possibility that
after this year we can change our branch because this is how our education system trains us
never even satisfied in your life.
So as we have discussed before in the best institute of the country technological institute
I mean here also when the students were asked so they are supposed to be more successful
but here also when they were asked how many of them are satisfied with the college and
branch that they have got 90 percent of them were dissatisfied.
So anyway the answer was I am afraid in our college it does not happen so I was disturbed
oh why is it like that similar college of another state it is doing that why we are
not doing in our institute so you know that is not possible in other colleges basis your
CGPA you can do it but in some of the colleges it's not possible.
So the scriptures mention Raghupad gives this common sense understanding if somebody tells
you that even after so much of hard work how much ever hard you may work you have freedom
to do it but then your salary will be fixed then why would a person work hard isn't it
so that is why it is very very important to understand in life what is fixed and what
is not what can be changed.
What is destined then I should remain satisfied with that and what is free will what lies
in my hand where is the control.
So these are very very important questions if something cannot be changed how much ever
hard you may work in the day you cannot get more than thousand rupees then why would a
person work hard he would save his time rather put the minimum effort but this knowledge
unfortunately is not known to us the knowledge of the destiny.
So we will discuss more about it this very important subject matter first let us cover
the verses of chapter 11 that we are discussing in the Bhagavad Gita the universal form and
in these verses Lord Krishna is giving very important understanding of the topic of today's
discussion so let us chant these verses.
We covered verse number 24 in the last class so let us now continue with verse number 25.
So to give you a background if somebody is new today some people would be so in this
11 chapter Lord Krishna is explaining to Arjuna how he has entered in this material universe
and this universe has taken various forms of static and dynamic moving living entities.
All these forms have developed just because Lord Krishna has entered.
So whatever a person can see in the universe because this entire universe is also expansion
of Krishna's body just like the soul enters this body and so many forms are manifest plants
trees grasses grasshoppers birds bees insects human beings men women and so many such wonderful
amazing forms we see around us all this is because of the presence of soul which is the
dimension which is mentioned in the Vedas is one by ten thousand of the tip of hair
is the size of soul it is so very small but then this huge form develops in a similar
fashion when Lord Krishna enters the universe in the form of Lord Vishnu the universe manifests
so many forms and because all these forms are coming from Krishna Krishna can show to
Arjuna whatever he desires to see in the universe.
So whatever exists in the universe Arjuna is able to see sitting at one place in this
universal form of Krishna which is called Virat Rupa and not just all the geography but even
this vision is transcending the limits of time past present future everything Arjuna is able to
see in this form and Arjuna becomes very much afraid because there are many many ghastly forms.
So Arjuna mentions
Arjuna got bewildered anybody will get bewildered if he sees entire universe all the forms in one
place so Arjuna got bewildered and then Arjuna explains
Arjuna recites
All the sons of Dhritarashtra along with their allied kings and Bhishma Drona and Karna
and all our soldiers are rushing into your mouths their heads smashed by your fearful teeth I see
that some are being crushed between your teeth as well. So because Srila Prabhupada is explaining
in the previous verse Lord Krishna promised to Arjuna whatever you desire to see you will
be able to see in this form so Arjuna was eager to understand the outcome of the battle
so thus he's seeing that all the soldiers they are entering into the mouth of this universal form
including the very powerful personalities like Bhishma who are supposed to be unconquerable
they are also entering the mouth of this universal form of Krishna.
Arjuna
how they are entering
As the river flows into the sea saw all these great warriors enter your blazing mouths and perish
as the rivers are flowing into the sea saw all these great warriors are entering into
your blazing mouths
so very important so Vedas are also very fond of this example it seems everywhere this Patanga
Patanga Matanga Kuranga Meena this example of Patanga comes always the example of moth
translation is I see all the people rushing with full speed into your mouths as moths dash into a
blazing fire so this study is required this is called education it is not the rote learning
that we usually undergo now education means simply by analyzing the world you can understand what is
truth what is reality as moths dash into blazing fire thinking I'll be happy but ultimately loses
its life similarly all the materialists in a bit to become happy they are embracing death creating
complications in their life so as the moth dashes into fire Krishna's form is also completely full
of brilliance and all the living entities are entering into that form Arjuna is able to thus
witness
oh Vishnu I see you devouring all people in your flaming mouths and covering the universe with
your immeasurable rays scorching the worlds you are manifest
oh lord of lords so fierce of form please tell me who you are I offer my
obeisances unto you please be gracious to me I do not know what your mission is
and I desire to hear of it lord krishna replies
ah the blessed lord said time I am destroyer of the worlds and I have come to engage all people
with the exception of you the Pandavas all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain
my eye
therefore get up and prepare to fight after conquering your enemies you will enjoy a
flourishing kingdom they are already put to death by my arrangement
and you or Savya Sachin can be but an instrument in the fight
the blessed lord said all the great warriors Drona, Bhishma, Jayadrath, Karna are already
destroyed simply fight and you will vanquish your enemies
so one of my cousins who was
a skeptic and when some of my relatives they wish to see
one of the astrologers who makes charts he is very famous in that area so he also went
because some drivers required to drive them to that place so he went along with them
and then this person he was they were speaking to him and my brother was skeptic you know
may be true may not be true we are not sure what is all this horoscope and the things they talk about
and this person looked towards my brother horoscope maker the pandit and he told that
something will strike you here and blood will come out from your forehead in the middle of the forehead
and my brother thought well why is telling like that and who knows he did not pay much attention
to it and very soon in a day or two he was supposed to catch the keys of the door or car
something some key and somebody threw it from the top and it struck him here and it started bleeding
so then he realized oh how this person could come to know
that i'm going to have some injury in this area like this various sciences were there another
devotee who was speaking to us his personal experience of this another shastra so we are
always hearing in prabhupa's lecture that there is this wonderful treatise by rishi bhrigu bhrigu
we do not know where it is so he has given this wonderful formula over there and the
descriptions are there by which you can tell past present and future of a person
and then in south still it is happening in the temples as we have discussed so because already
we have covered something of this topic in our mantra yoga and jaygyasa workshops so we'll build
upon it for details you can please try not to miss it in the next cycle when we do it these
workshops so this person explained that how this is a place chidambaram and kanchipuram two places
are there where this practice is in existence where you go there you give simply your thumb
impression they will not ask your horoscope they will simply ask your thumb impression
and simply they would take that and there are already some scripts written on the palm leaves
and the basis their thumb impression they would try to take out some leaves which are close to it
and because you know it is very difficult to examine minutely maybe five to ten they will pick
out which is matching your thumb impression and they will ask whether this is your parents name
so they only will prompt you need not tell anything apart from giving your thumb impression
and they will prompt is this your father's name mother's name and then actually he was surprised
so initially he was not getting it took him some 20 or 25 scripts then ultimately his
father's and mother's name they were mentioned and then he was surprised at all the things of the
past they were able to tell not all i mean the major things which happened in his life and then
they told about future also and then he was speaking to me after five six years of this incident
and he told although i did not actively pursue what is written but somehow i saw i had no plans
after my btech what i am going to do but then somehow the things so arranged there was no plan
at all for higher studies but i went for higher studies and then so many other things he explained
how it happened in his life so this itself was surprising that already there is a script his
father's and mother's name is mentioned over there and his friend also went along with him or after
him he was telling so his friend he got his script in the second hit itself first one was not his
second script it was written his father's mother's name and all the other things so all these
wonderful things are there if a person examines minutely then he can very well understand how
these things are so scientific and ample evidence proof is there especially in our country where we
have so many people still although perfectly you may not find anybody who knows the science now
this is almost lost but still to a very good extent you can find sufficient proofs and resources
and to of course a very wide whenever we you know visit people and some simple people we meet they
still have strong faith they ask immediately they stretch out their palms that swamiji can you please
tell what is our future they are very eager to know what lies in future so there are still ample
evidences if you take out time you will develop strong faith and otherwise we have discussed in
our workshops also how shreemad bhagavatam it mentions the exact prediction of the personalities
prediction of lord chatanya prediction of buddha prediction of mauryan dynasty how many years they
are going to rule how many kings are going to be there in dynasty so all these things are amazingly
fixed so thus it is very very important to understand discover what is fixed in our life
and what is not fixed so although people are very very eager to understand what is their future
but this very important thing is
somehow not in the consciousness that even though i may come to know that the pravapa tells
astrology is not meant for intelligent people because whatever is going to happen in your life
that is going to happen just like kashyap muni kashyap muni was a very powerful sage
and when he enjoyed physical pleasure with his wife and immediately after that although he could
not control his lust after that he told that this was wrong time to conceive the child
and not one child you are going to deliver two babies twins and these
twins would create disaster in this world they will do all wrong activities they would upset the
order as created for the welfare of the living entities and they would be enemy of pious people
and the demigods and whole world would be put into chaos by their powers by their activities
so when dithi heard that she got very much disturbed and then he also predicted but there
is one good news that they will be killed by lord vishnu himalayas and they will be killed by lord
vishnu himself and thus they will get liberated so hearing this she got some solace oh lord vishnu
ultimately will come and even if lord vishnu kills somebody they get liberated so this was some
solace there at least they will not suffer for their activities so although kashyap muni that
point to be noted here is although kashyap muni was knowing what is going to happen in future
still he was not able to check the force of destiny so first thing is we have to
know what is fixed and what is not fixed and even if we know we have to know we cannot change it
the living entity is completely helpless in the hands of the laws of nature
and even if a person does not go for in research work visiting astrologers
and finding proof for the all the shastras
still with common sense we can understand so just like we see so many life forms around us
and we have discussed before amply that how we are not the body and those who don't understand
we'll practice mantra meditation in some time and then you will realize that you are not the body
because you want to focus on the sound but your mind is going somewhere so it is easy to understand
i am not the body because i change the body all the organs of the body can be changed the blood
can be changed air anyway is changing we are breathing in breathing out so all the tissue
cells of the body are constantly changing eyes can be changed liver can be changed heart can be
changed but you remain the observer through this machine you are different you are different from
body you are different from mind you control the mind you notice the wanderings of the mind
so all the souls which are existing
why they have not got the same body
we like that our children should not suffer why this tendency is present in us that our children
should be happy because this tendency should be present in our origin also it is very simple to
understand why we have tendency to eat why the soul desires to eat why the soul desires to play
why the souls desire to socialize why the soul desires to hear nice music because all these
tendencies should be present in our source also unless these tendencies are present in our source
we cannot manifest these tendencies a drop cannot manifest any property which is not present in the
ocean however an ocean will have many things which are not present in the drop so god has
got many more qualities features which we don't display but all the features qualities which we
are displaying must be present in god because we are coming from god so understanding destiny is
very very simple there are laws acting in our life a simple example prabhupada gives that if
you eat something without hunger you overeat the next day you will have indigestion you have to fast
your quota for eating is over if you sleep more in the daytime night time you'll not get sleep
sleep quota is over so now if you contaminate some virus you will get diseased in this way laws are
acting laws leave nobody you touch fire a hand will be burnt so in this way there are laws acting
in our life so why the living entity some living entities have got some bodies which are not
suitable for enjoyment just like the dog body or the animal's body always fearful always they are
very very scared somebody will throw stone another body will come they will be devoured
by those bodies so very horrible animal life bird life no shelter so why such bodies they have got
in which so much trouble and suffering is there why not everybody is very handsome good-looking
human being intelligent and we are all sons of god god would not like to put anybody in trouble
and krishna tells in bhagavad gita also i am equal to all the living entities
so we have to understand from the evidence of the scriptures god is telling i am equal to all
and through common sense also we can understand that we would not like our children to suffer
give them a bad machine so why krishna or god has given bad machine to some people in which they are
suffering some people are having deformed bodies or diseased bodies from the birth
thus you see so many ads coming they are requesting our son or daughter is suffering please give us
money for the operation although they are very very young but they have taken birth with this
very dangerous disease there is no time to perform any actions activities but then they have got bad
body and krishna is equal to all it means just like the judge is equal to all but somebody is
given punishment basis their own actions in a similar fashion we can understand bases are
activities of the past life in this life we get arrangements for pleasure or suffering
now what kind of pleasure suffering is fixed in our life so the scriptures mention for this we
have to understand law we cannot speculate just like as i gave example in the beginning of the
session in our college it was not the system that you can change your branch in other college it is
the system that you can do it and in some colleges in india you of course before entering the college
you choose it in west you study the courses in second year you choose the branch of graduation
so like this there are different systems in different places you have to understand law
as soon as you have taken admission in certain college you have done that kind of activity
what freedom you have and what is fixed in your life
you have taken admission in a day school then 12 to 5 will be your school you have taken admission
in morning school then 7 to 1 or 12 would be your school this is fixed so in this way basis your
activities few things are fixed it cannot be speculated we have to understand from the law books
and thus the law books are called dharma shastras they are around 20 number beginning with manu
samhita and of course we are not going to go into details because we learn how to come out
of this entangling process but nevertheless few things broadly bhagavatam describes are fixed
in our life and they are first of all as soon as we take birth our cause of death becomes fixed
that is anyway fixed the cause of death is also fixed and not the time duration but the
number of breaths we are going to take that is also fixed that is how the yogis are able to
elongate their breaths and thus when the yogi is confident that now i can travel to the desired
destination i can decide my next parents next place of birth and when he's fixed in his destination
then he finishes his breathing cycles and thus he travels to another body until then yogi elongates
his breath unless he's confident that i'm fixed up in thoughts of my destination so this is how the
people understand and utilize the science of breathing cycles they are fixed so cause of death
is fixed the breathing cycles are fixed education is fixed beauty is fixed and riches are fixed
fixed and fixed what does it mean fixed means
just like when you take take up a job let's say typically a government job
then your salary becomes fixed what does it mean fixed even if you do not go to office will it
remain fixed so these people don't understand they tell oh if destiny is there then let me sleep
whatever is going to happen will happen so it is told in the vedas nahi suptasya singhasya
all the lion is very very powerful animal but tiger singh who is sleeping
means the animals or the rabbit will not come and enter into tiger's mouth my dear tiger you
are so powerful let me come and enter your mouth anyway you'll come out and eat me no
this is not going to happen so even though tiger is very powerful he has to do he goes out he can
hunt animals easily but he has to do some minimal endeavor to go out and hunt animals
so in a similar fashion we have to do regulated endeavor in order to get those things which are
already fixed once you take admission in school or college passing out is very very easy but
minimal things just go and sit there have that minimal attendance write few basic things in
the exam and clearing that is not very difficult task so once you take admission in school or
college your degree becomes fixed once you take take up a job your salary becomes fixed even if
you work very very hard in that position that post your salary is fixed but minimum time you
have to attend your office 10 to 5 whatever and then you will get your salary in a similar
fashion all these things are fixed in our life provided we do regulated endeavor
so that is why the scriptures tell us this very important fact people do not understand
so the world is going crazy and they are telling please work very hard and then you will become
super success and very happy and people were in illusion and then they see what is happening
in the world because it's hard hard work and competition the japan is becoming childless
because of this tremendous competition there is a competition the person who
you know who does not doze off in japan they feel that he's not working hard enough
and if you doze off during the office hours you struggle then you are taken to be good worker
very hard worker and people are so much stressed but the culture is so set up of this hard work
that they cannot do anything and so many suicides are happening depression is happening government
wanted to give relief so they made friday half friday half day but still the people are so much
you know consumed by this culture of competition they are always looking at each other's face so
half day but who will be the first person to leave office and then nobody wants to leave they
ultimately end up working full day that day also so like this is the culture women they also want
to compete with men so they don't want to produce child because if you produce child maternity
post maternity leave and such and then you lag behind in your career race so thus there are no
children over there and the government is worried that there are no children in japanese would not
exist in your future so this is the result of hard work and the whole world is in trouble now
people would work earlier eight hours it became 10 10 became 12 now 15 hours has become norm
so and it will continue to increase because you work 15 hours other person will work 16 hours where
is the limit but this is all completely illusion because your riches education beauty all these
things are fixed and moreover it is written the happiness and distress overall happiness and
distress of one's life is also fixed so it is only under illusion that a person thinks i can
attain more of these things by working very very hard and now people are realizing so there are
various ways various books like four hour work week where so many case studies are there people
reduce their working hours and by working four hours in a week their productivity also increased
a lot and so many other corporations are there which are telling this hard work is an illusion
that you become more successful by that but nevertheless blind civilization do not know
people are working hard creating complications in life so we have to understand this very important
factor that in this life so prahlada maharaj gives a very nice shloka so the things are fixed
in your life so then balance time what i am supposed to do so prahlada maharaj tells
this
very important shloka he tells therefore means intelligent person means endeavor a person who
is learned or wise he does not work hard for anything which is available in this universe
means down we go upwards in the universe you find many planets so earth falls in the middle of the
universe as per the descriptions of the scriptures and if you go downwards again you'll find many
many planets but everything is under control of material nature and time so prahlada maharaj tells
so as you attain misery in this life similarly happiness also will come on its own
we are working very very hard for material benefits material sensual pleasures but we don't
work hard for sensual misery material troubles but they do come in our life nobody worked hard
for covid pandemic but it has happened nobody works hard to meet with an accident but accidents
do happen nobody works hard to have breakups in life but they do happen we always want loving
relationships we always want safe driving good health no disease but nevertheless these things
do happen so prahlada maharaj is telling just like distress comes into your life without working
for it similarly happiness material happiness will also follow automatically in your life
why so a person may tell after working so much still distress is coming to my life
it means if i do not work then more distress will come so no this is not the right logic
so it is very beautifully explained in the bhagavatam why this logic is wrong because
happiness and distress both are different name given to the same object actually happiness and
distress are two sides of coin of this material existence for example if you ask somebody
so death is misery or happiness they will tell oh death is definitely misery
and you ask them birth is misery or happiness no birth is very good we celebrate our birthdays
and we mourn the death day but we have to understand as soon as there is birth
death is already fixed so happiness and distress they come in pairs in this world
similarly vacations are happiness or not no vacations are happiness only if you have had
distress of the exams a person who has not faced exams or schools or colleges then vacation is
nothing special for him he will not become happy in that so if you ask somebody fever is happiness
or distress so there is no absolute answer so 100 degree temperature can be happiness for somebody
because he was suffering for from 104 fevers for many days and today it is 100 he or she
would feel happy so in this way it is being told here happiness and distress are two sides of the
same coin somebody is in my family they are not keeping well i get distressed because of it why
because i desire to take pleasure in their pleasure in their happiness i am having
attachment with them i want to enjoy with them oh my wife is not cooking for me i get distressed
why because we enjoy wife cooking for ourselves
so we have to understand our happiness and distress they are two sides of the same point so many
people are not cooking for you why you're not in stress because of them because you never desired
happiness from them if you desire happiness from your relatives then distress also will come so
many people are dying in the world but we are not affected but somebody whom we choose to derive
happiness from that same person we have to derive even distress from isn't it and this is the play
of time this element called time factor the time does not let anything remain in a permanent
situation so thus sometimes you will get respect from your from your spouse and then you think oh
that is very nice and sometimes they will hurt your feelings and then you will feel bad because
you chose to get happiness from the respect so that is why when there is disrespect you feel
distress so many other people are not respecting you not even calling you you don't bother but
somebody if you take enjoyment in their call and they don't call you you feel distressed so this
happiness and distress are two sides of the same coin only people who are completely ignorant
and that means all of us now in this age of kaliyuga who do not know the simple philosophy
this common sense understanding try to increase material happiness of our life which is another
side of distress so pralad maharaj tells because happiness and distress they are the same thing
and distress we know it comes without invitation so the other side of distress happiness also will
come without any invitation so that is why any intelligent living entity should not work hard
for material happiness and distress rather we should work hard for coming out of this situation
of compromising happiness and distress so we don't want that okay let there be some distress
and some happiness in my life i want uncontaminated happiness so that is not possible on material
platform where things are being controlled by time so here lord krishna declares i am the time
factor i control everything in this world i create and i destroy all the living entities
and thus krishna showed here that all these people are being consumed by the time factor
they are entering in the mouth
and everything krishna tells to arjuna it is already being planned by me so arjuna was again
calculating so the main problem in our life is that we are very very expert plan makers there
are five years plan and or 20 years plan people plan in their entire life they have bucket lists
these many things i should do in this year or next year or before i die and they plan very nicely
and this planning is the cause of all distress because they miss out the plan of god so just
like the government makes a plan that this road should come into existence so because some of you
may ask so krishna planned that all the leaders are going to die then what is the role of arjuna
so arjuna is being requested to become an instrument so just like the government decides
let there be a road let there be highway or expressway so this government has decided
to make the expressway now various instruments are required so what is the freedom given to
the living entity the freedom given to the living entities he can choose which instrument i should
become an engineer is instrument in making the roads laborer is also an instrument in making the
roads and a contractor is also an instrument in making the roads like this various instruments
are there and there will be somebody who would be recruiting hr people for engaging in this way
so he's also an instrument there will be somebody who would be managing the finances he's another
instrument transport another instrument so many instruments are required but ultimately decision
is made by the government that i have to make this road in a similar fashion we have to understand
god has got certain plan here in this world so the wisdom is to understand the plan of the god just
like the contractors they are very very eager to understand what is the plan of government if they
think that government is going to invest in this it industry they would launch an it industry
immediately if the government is planning to make new roads as we just discussed they would be ready
to you know get the contract so in a similar fashion we should understand what is the plan
of god and we should be very very eager to participate in that plan and that is the way
to become happy but unfortunately if a person is in ignorance of this knowledge instead of
participating sometimes he tries to work against the plan of lord and thus he suffers in his life
so this living entity can only be an instrument we cannot think that okay let me make an express way
over here no living entity does not have that right an ordinary citizen just like he does not
have the right government has the right to know to plan township to plan the entire nation and
the living entity the common citizens they have to submit accordingly to the government
now the government has to run the country so a person can become as powerful as a minister
and ministers enjoy so many facilities you can become bureaucrats you enjoy so many facilities
or you can become an ordinary government servant and again you will enjoy facilities as per the
responsibility which you have taken the more a person is knowledgeable wise the higher position
he is given in the service of lord so that is why it is told in the scriptures
that human life is meant only all the activities that we are doing in our life
the purpose of all the activities to understand that road to cultivate knowledge
so the more a living entity cultivates knowledge he becomes responsible the more freedom a living
entity gets in life and the more the living entity is in ignorance just like the animals
they almost have no freedom so the more we are under the influence of tamoguna the more we are
the less we are free the more we are satvik the more freedom we have in our life so these people
do not know these basic sciences so that is why it is told by shila roop goswami somehow or the
other we should try to associate more and more with the satbhaguna in our life and the more we
cultivate satbhaguna the more freedom we will have and if we are following spiritual practices
we are even beyond satbhaguna we are in shuddh satbhaguna so although ordinarily a person may
ask oh prabhu so it is very tough so if i have to suffer means i have to suffer this disease is
going to come in my life and if bad relationship is there in my life i have to suffer if death has
to come in this fashion i have to suffer there is no way i can change the answer is ordinarily yes
you cannot change the laws of nature will come but unfortunately people are struggling against
their destiny and when they do not get the desired results they become depressed and they die
prematurely suffer much more than their destiny because the living entity has got some freedom
if we are put into jail now these five things which we have discussed this also can be changed
by us because we are not robot but that change will not be lasting and that change will create
misery for us the example given is if a person commits suicide now that is not natural you chose
to die so because you committed unnatural thing if a person was sitting in jail now if somebody
tries to bring that person out of jail or he skips out of jail he'll be given more punishment he has
to tolerate so similarly if the living entity has been put into certain body he is not allowed to
commit suicide he has to tolerate whatever is coming his way or her way otherwise if a person
leaves his body he may think oh all the miseries are gone but so much more miseries he'll be put
unto so all these things are not known to people in this your person works very hard accumulates
lot of money he tells see i do overwork i work extra hours and then i get more money but no sir
working extra hours even if you are able to fetch more money by that first of all even after
working out some people are not able to become very rich everyone is working hard everyone should
become rich otherwise but still if you see direct proportion between the hours you are putting in
the money you are earning that money is not going to stay is not going to sustain some disease will
come some calamity will come or you will die leaving that money behind some other person will
enjoy your relative will enjoy some thief will enjoy or government will enjoy but we will enjoy
only as per what is there in our destiny so this is very very important to understand
thus the bhagavata mentions so a person should tolerate krishna is telling in bhagavad gita
so you do regulated endeavor how much endeavor bhagavata mentions so although we have discussed
these things before but it is very very important because we are not able to implement easily these
things bhagavata mentions maximum eight hours of work if anybody is putting more than eight hours
of work he or she is in illusion so you have realized in your life even after working very
hard there is loss of job there is loss of health there is loss of so many things even after putting
best of your capacity to serve the family members family members are dissatisfied so all these things
will come as per the force of destiny we should not we should accept not put never put more than
eight hours in our regular duties so balance time should be cultivated to come out of destiny yes
there is a way ordinarily although it cannot be changed but lord krishna mentions as we'll see in
the 18th chapter of bhagavad gita surrender completely unto me i will free you from all the
reactions of past sinful activities so thus we are suffering only because of past activities
and if you want to avoid all this suffering the solution is completely surrendering to krishna
and those people who surrender to krishna anyway what is going to happen as we see here in this
verse krishna has decided all these people on both the sides except the pandavas they are going to be
killed as you can see on the screen krishna is requesting arjuna arjuna please become instrument
now all those fighters were very very strong on the other side much more powerful than arjuna
bheeshma drona karna everybody but then arjuna was able to kill them all because krishna already had
decided they would die arjuna was thinking oh they are my relatives if i don't kill them
it would be nice and let them enjoy the property but he was not knowing that they are already dead
in this battle i fight or i do not fight krishna will find another instrument in this manner please
don't take we request undue anxiety in your life understand material resources if they are present
does not make you more happy if they're absent it does not make you more distressed we are spirit
soul different from the body we need resources just to maintain body and soul together that's it
not to enjoy the more you try to enjoy the senses you create distress in life
so we are spirit soul our real happiness is spiritual happiness
so please try to regulate your arts and surrender completely unto krishna and krishna being very
merciful although he does everything as per his plan but credit is given to the instrument arjuna
got all the credit of killing all the living entities great fighters on the other side
so in a similar fashion krishna gives credit to his dear devotees and it is not very difficult
to understand what is krishna's plan krishna's plan is simple we are all sons of krishna
the plan of parents is to see that children are happy all the living entities are unhappy here
simply because they do not know they are the body they are eternal they can stop this process of
birth and death disease for good permanently so any living entity who understands this plan of
krishna that this knowledge is very important by spreading this knowledge and implementing in my
life i will be happy others would be happy and that is krishna's plan in this way by participating
in krishna's plan we can increase unlimited happiness in our life otherwise happiness and
distress they are two sides of the same coin as distress comes automatically in our life
happiness also flows automatically on material platform it cannot be changed
so let us surrender to krishna and how we can surrender
to krishna because there could be still a lot of confusion so all this confusion as we have seen
lord krishna mentions
in 10th chapter of bhagavad gita
so anybody who is engaged in the service of krishna all the knowledge is revealed by krishna
who is seated in the heart of the living entities this is called the process of bhakti yoga whatever
capacity we have we should use arjuna was fighter he fought in the capacity of a warrior
and thus his life became successful so it is very simple simply we have to engage ourselves in the
service of krishna and then all clarity will come and we will be able to surrender and this process
begins the service to krishna begins with chanting and hearing his names so simply by chanting
harry krishna now we may be having doubts and confusions so all those doubts confusions will be
vanished more and more we will elevate ourselves on the satvik platform more and more freedom will
come as we chant this harry krishna maha mantra you will realize that i'm experiencing more
freedom initially we are helpless oh i want to do i am not able to do you know in our college we
remember so in the ragging period the seniors would tell us that you please wake up us early
in the morning at this time and the juniors the people in the first year were so helpless
they were not in a habit of because they have been slogging entire night for admission into college
so they cannot get up early in the morning so entire night they would not sleep so a person
has no free will that he can even get up early in the morning so helpless like this we have so
many habits and we are helpless all this helplessness will gradually reduce so the process is very simple
with great attention with great care understanding at least theoretically in the beginning that
krishna only is present in the form of his name in this way if we practice this chanting of harry
krishna maha mantra freedom will increase in our life knowledge will increase in our life and then
we'll perfectly understand the science and we will not just be happy in this life all the forces
of destiny will stop acting upon us and after this life there is no more taking of these
material bodies which are full of misery so let us practice this meditation with great care and
attention so this is very simple hurry krishna hurry krishna krishna krishna hurry hurry
hurry ram hurry ram ram ram hurry hurry these 16 words we have to chant and we have to hear
attentively we have to vibrate the tongue not just in mind and one special mantra in the beginning
all spiritual success lies on the foundation of chanting this harry krishna maha mantra in the
