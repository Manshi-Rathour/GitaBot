We have seen so far. What is the meaning of the three modes of nature or three gunas as we call in Sanskrit, guna means quality and guna also means rope. So these are three qualities which also act as binding agents in this material world. Just like we prepare a nice foodstuff and various ingredients, they combine together to make the substance of the food. But they also have unique attributes. You may have sugar, salt, fat, carbohydrates and so many other factors. So they all make up the substance as well as they add their unique qualities into the food. In a similar fashion, all the substance that we see around us in this material world, material energy, it is made up of three modes of nature and they also add their unique qualities into it. And we saw the example of a person who is driving without knowledge in ignorance of the laws of traffic and speed limits, he would suffer. Another person who is driving in passion with desire to drive fast, he will also suffer. He will maybe dash somebody, create an accident or cross the limits simply because of uncontrolled senses jump the signal. And a person who is perfectly knowing the law senses are also under control. Man of goodness, he also gets conditioned. And he's not able to reach his destination. Because he does not inquire about destination. He thinks I am happy, so let me keep on driving happily. But simply driving happily is not the purpose of driving. Similarly, simply happily living in this world is not the purpose of creation. The purpose is to give living entities chance to go transcend this world. Because how much ever good you are in this world, death will happen, disease will happen, old age will happen and rebirth will happen. And in any of the subsequent births, if we come in contact with the lower modes, we will degrade into lower species where there would be suffering. So the aim is you keep yourself in Satvoguna so that you are not disturbed by lower modes. And thus you can understand absolute truth and promote yourself to spiritual platform. The spiritual world. So it is told in Srimad Bhagavatam karthiwad dharunodhumas tasmad agnir trimayah rajas tamasas to paras Rajastasmath Yas Satvam Brahmadarshanam transformation of earth is wood and transformation of wood is smoke. But smoke is better than wood and better than smoke is fire. Because from fire, when we do sacrifice, we follow the rituals, then we can attain whatever we want. This is the Vedic culture. You do yajnas put offerings in the fire and then you can fulfill your desires in a similar fashion. Better than Tamuguna is rajoguna. Tamasastu rajasthasmath. But better than rajoguna is Satvaguna. On Satvaguna. Yes. Satvam Brahma Darshanam We can understand Brahma, the supreme personality of Godhead. So if we have to understand God, we have to be in goodness. We have to be a good person. Only a person in the mode of goodness can understand God. And if we are in the contamination of lower modes then we will not be able to understand God. And there would be many many troubles for us. So just like a person is very alert nowadays people go for regular checkup. Now after 30 years of age they recommend heart attacks can happen anytime. So please go for regular checkups. So people check what is the cholesterol level? What is the sugar level? It should be low within the limits. In a similar fashion we should always be cautious that rajoguna and tamoguna is not increasing in my body. If my body gets more of rajoguna and tamoguna then life is very dangerous. Now I would suffer and the future is very dark. So how do we understand? There is a blood test and there are many kinds of tests by which we can analyze the sugar samples and various other parameters of the body. But how do we understand measure this parameter of Rajas and Tamas within our body? That is why Lord Krishna is now explaining in this chapter the manifestations how these modes are manifest in our body and mind. So that we can get to know oh, now rajoguna is increasing, tamoguna is increasing. Let me be cautious and try to subdue it. And Satvoguna should increase in our body. So what are the effects of these modes by which we can analyze their presence? An increment or decrease? We will try to understand. Text number eleven sarvadwarishude Hismin Prakasha Upajayat Ganam Yadata David Vivradham Satva Mityuta the manifestations of the modes of goodness can be experienced when all the gates of the body are illuminated by knowledge. So there are nine gates in this body or nine holes. This body is also called city of nine gates. A person lives in the city. So we as spirit, soul are living in this body and it is having nine gates or nine holes. Eyes, ears, mouth, nose, genitals and rectum. So when all the modes, all the gates of the body are illuminated by the modes of goodness illuminated by knowledge then we can understand that I am in goodness. Srila Prabhupada explains in every gate when the symptom of goodness is illuminated it should be understood that one has developed the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness one can see things in the right position. One can hear things in the right position and one can taste things in the right position. One becomes cleansed inside and outside. In every gate there is development of the symptoms of happiness and that is the position of goodness. So in every gate there is development of the symptom of happiness. Satvaguna leads to happiness. When you are feeling happy in the eyes, happy in ears and happy in all the gates that means there is goodness. When your eyes are viewing the forms of God. When the ears are taking interest in hearing the music or sound of God or the instructions of God. When our tongue is tasting prasadam of God when our vocal cords are vibrating the sound of God, the instructions of God in this way we can understand I am transcendental and the same modes. When they are in Satvoguna, the eyes are seeing satvic forms. Nature, mountains, rivers they are interested in that. They are not interested in seeing artificial forms of cities, skyscrapers and so many other materially attractive things. Rajastic things which we have created. So that is why Sathwich people want to live in natural places. They go to mountains and natural serene places. So that is called mode of goodness. Similarly music you want to hear music is also Satvik and music is also rajasik for sense gratification. And music is also tamsik. We see rock music and other things. So they are very horrible, so disturbing. But some people do enjoy it. In a similar fashion. The food also is in the mode of tamoguna, meat and other things. You give it to a satvic person, he would vomit. He cannot taste that. And those people who are hardcore meat eaters you give them satvic food, they will not be able to develop taste in it. So in this way we can understand. When all the modes are happy and they are established on Satvik platform then we can understand. We are in satvaguna. Then evacuation. If we eat nice food, there is proper evacuation. And when evacuation is nice, person is cleansed inside. Cleanliness is important externally. By taking bath inside. By evacuation, stomach cleaning should happen every day. And when this evacuation happens nicely then a person is happy in mind also. And if he is energetic, he can work very nicely in satvoguna. So in this way we should see that all the nine gates whether they are satvik or not then how do we see manifestation of rajoguna and tamoguna? Lobha, pravritir Arambhah, Karmanam, Pasha, Mahriha, Rajasthani, jayante, Viveridhe, Bharatar, Shabha, Ochi of the Bharatas when there is an increase in the mode of passion the symptom of great attachment, uncontrollable desire, hankering and intense endeavor develop. So we can relate. Most of us are in this mode the denizens of this planet. But our culture is so nice. Now we are being pulled down into even tamsik mode. Otherwise this is prominent on earthly planets. One in the mode of passion is never satisfied with the position he has already acquired. He hankers to increase his position. If he wants to construct a residential house he tries his best to have a palatial house. As if he would be able to reside in that house eternally. And he develops a great hankering for sense gratification. There is no end to sense gratification. He always wants to remain with his family and in his house and to continue the process of sense gratification. There is no cessation of this. All these symptoms should be understood as characteristic of the mode of passion. Someone is never satisfied with the position he has already acquired. So earlier people were satisfied. They get a job and mostly entire life they will pass doing that job. But now nobody is satisfied. And people become uncomfortable when they see somebody in their company is not changing job. As one devotee was telling other people are telling me that so many people with you they have gone to other institutions, good institutions. They have changed their jobs. What are you doing in the same company for so many years? So because he's following Krishna consciousness and the workplace is very close to where our folk residency is. And we get association of devotees. What else is required in life? And the happiness distress that we already discussed that is fixed in life by hard work. We cannot change destiny. Yes, every action has a reaction. So if you work very hard, you will as a matter of the laws they will produce some reaction. So you can directly see the result. You work overtime and then there is more money. Of course, sometimes that also does not come. But you can see if you put more effort, you'll get some results. So that is a fact. By working very hard you might be able to generate more money. But if it is not in destiny, we will not be able to enjoy that money. Thus we see so many crowdfunding campaigns. People are willing to raise more and more money. What they are earning now nature is taking away all of that. Plus they have to take so much of debts also. So this is called destiny. You may work very hard, you may become educated. But you'll be on the streets if the laws of nature don't allow you that money. So one might be able to accumulate money. But either the money will go away. Doctors will take it away, lawyers will take it away, thieves will take it away, market will take it away. Or next generation would enjoy sons, grandsons would enjoy. They have money in their destiny. Without work it will go to them. But we will be able to enjoy the opulence which is due to us because of our actions in the past. So these people do not realize and they want to just keep on hopping. Switching the jobs and switching the life partners and switching so many things. People are not satisfied. They want to go to this country, go to that country. All this is because of rajoguna. So earlier you were not having these flights. How would you travel to different country? So this is called Anartha. Anartha means something which is not required. People were not dying without foreign trips. We should understand. People were not dying without watching so many sporting matches. People were not dying without watching movies and hearing so many songs. Civilization was going on and going on happily. But we create artificial necessities of life. This is wonderful. Use of intelligence create artificial necessities of life. And then work very hard to fulfill that and chase that and remain dissatisfied. So because of Rajaguna, person is not satisfied. Earlier he's living in the village. In next village he gets married or she gets married and all the relatives and friends are there in the same village. And he lives very nicely in joint family with all the relatives eats nights naturally homegrown, food and lives a very peaceful life. Happy life with all his relatives and family members. Now even basic health and pleasure of relationships, family, even that is not there. People cannot see the face of their children also husband, wife, children all are separate working hard entire day, entire life. So this is the curse of Kaliyuga. You cannot have pleasure of even family life which is afforded to everybody. This is our wonderful use of intelligence, our education we want to create complexity in our life. So this is because of mode of passion. People are not satisfied in one place 3 hours he will travel every day to work to and fro and he will travel to the other end of the globe. What is the need of traveling so far? But no, he will travel. So because of mode of passion people are restless. They just want to keep on roaming around, jumping around jobs, locations and all these things. So in the mode of passion one is never satisfied with the position. He has already acquired more and more hankering is always there. He hankers to increase his position. So somebody texted me today how the richest people of the world they are also not satisfied. When the richest people of world are not satisfied so nobody's satisfied. This is a great illusion but our heart will always have this palpitation disturbance anchoring that will keep us disturbed. He wants to construct a residential house and we want to have a palatial house. This is called mode of passion. Nobody was making palatial houses before. You will not find any house standing for a very very long time but only temples and ports. He develops a great hankering for sense gratification and there is no end to sense enjoyment. You know how much people are spending money? They want to go to helicopter or some planes and want to jump from there. Paragliding, para diving, whatever we call it. And then they want to what is that called? Scuba diving. They want to go deep into water and bungee jumping and so many nonsense activities which are not required. But monkey rajoguna Rajasikna monkey is jumping from one tree to another. He is jumping from trying to imitate animals. So human life is meant to become more sane and controlled. But he's trying to imitate animals so nature will make them monkeys keep on jumping from one mountain to another. So we earn so much of money and spend so much of money like that there is no unlimited artificial necessities. We would create and work very hard to satisfy them. He always wants to remain with his family. So remaining with the family is also because of mode of passion. So much of material attachment is there. Prabhupada gives very nice example. When you go outside the shop of a tailor or garment shop, you'll find some mannequins, plastic or fiberglass statues. Nobody gets attracted to such fiberglass statues. Because we understand that is not real form. Although it looks like real. In a similar fashion, this is just combination of pus, mucus, bile. Actual forms are made up of spirit. But this material world simply imitation is there. One body is given to us, so it is just 1 mm deep illusion. So, if the skin is burnt off, if just this small very thin covering of skin is taken out, we would run away from the person we love the most, is it not? But this 1 skin creates such an illusion that a person becomes mad after this body. Simply, if you take the small skin out, all the illusion, the material forms, the beauty is clear. If somebody gives us a teddy beer full of stool, urine, pus, mucus and blood, we will throw it away. But this body we find very attractive. This is the illusion of God. So sometimes when the illusory energy creates strong lust in us, so we can contemplate in this way also that I am getting attracted towards this combination of the abominable substances within the body. The real forms are there. In the spiritual world, this material world is imitation. So, no sane person gets attracted to fiberglass statues, the mannequins in a similar fashion, no sane person, satvic person in knowledge will get attracted to such forms. But when we are Rajasik, we get illusioned for material sense enjoyment. Then we get attracted to such forms and we want to continue living. And we create so called families. Travelers, they make temporary association and we always want to stay in that association. So, sattvic persons means the Brahminical class, they would go to the gurukul and mostly they would continue. They would not enter into family life. And some of them will enter, but compulsorily, they will take sannyas. Just like every respectable person goes to school. Now, in our country, girls were not being sent to school and other places also everywhere. This was a culture. But now, every respectable family will send girls also to school. This is a culture. Now. Similarly, Vedic culture is 50 years of age. You go to jungle, no respectable person will stay at home. So thus, Ajamal story is mentioned in Shirimad Bhagwatam. He stayed at his house and his age is 80 plus years. So now it is very normal. In old age, a person but will stay at home. We need to take care of him. But this is not Vedic culture. This is abominable life. Vedic culture is you should die in such a way that family members do not come to know. So, after 50 years, you leave the house and you may live with wife, because attachment between husband and wife is very strong. And then you go for pilgrimage, and then you leave the wife in care of the family members, and then you go alone. Now we see people are old, family doesn't care. And the situation is like that of a dog. He lives in one house and they would supply some food to him. Nobody cares for him. His opinion is no more valued. The same son for which he was having so much affection son would argue, reply back, nobody gives any respect. The situation becomes very abominable in old age. Thus old people, they just want to vent out. They want to find a person to speak. So Vedic culture is very scientific, so materially and spiritually. So person should die in such a way. Family does not come to know about their death. That is the glorious death. And thus, if you ask the elderly people, grandparents or some other elderly family members, they would tell earlier, when people would go for pilgrimage, they would be given a very nice farewell, because it was not sure they would return or not. Sometimes they may not come back. And sometimes people would die because they have to travel and it's not very comfortable journey, and they may not come back. So the farewell was given in such a way that they are expecting, they may not come back. Pilgrimage itself. So this is Vedic culture ultimate aim of life. Everyone knows, but sometimes, if the forces of body are very strong, you stay in house for some time, but after 50 years, you please leave, you go out. So 80 plus years, a person is still at home. So Bhagwatam is telling it is garitham, very abominable activity. What is being mentioned, how somebody can stay at house after 80 years. So just like if somebody has not found a job, is staying at house after 2030 years. So that is, people would tell what your son or daughter is doing. They have not got a job after so many years. So there is no end to sense gratification. He always wants to remain with his family and in his house, and to continue the process of sense gratification. There is no cessation of this. All these symptoms should be understood as characteristic of the mode of passion. Getting stuck with these illusory temporary forms. Then what are the symptoms of Tamuguna aprakasho pravritesha Pramado mohawacha tamasaitani jayante vivridhuru nandana o son of Kuru? When there is an increase in the mode of ignorance, madness, illusion and inertia and darkness are manifested. When there is no illumination, knowledge is absent. One in the mode of ignorance does not work by a regulative principle. He wants to act whimsically for no purpose. Even though he has the capacity to work, he makes no endeavor. This is called illusion. Although consciousness is going on, life is inactive. These are the symptoms of one in the mode of ignorance. So we see some wretched people, criminals or ruffians. So all these people are in the mode of ignorance, very lazy and good for nothing. What they do, it destroys them and others also, even though there is capacity of working person does not work tamsik they are into intoxication other things as Krishna further explains. Yada satva pravridhu pralayam yati dehabrit tadotama vidam lokan amalan pratipadyate. So these are the immediate effects, manifestations, what we saw here, what are the long term effects of it? So just like if you have more cholesterol in the body then you will have some symptoms. There would be pain in the legs and in the joints and some heaviness and such things are mentioned. And what is the long term effect? You will get heart attack, you will die. So these we saw the immediate manifestations and what are the long term effects that you get? So that Lord Krishna explains, when one dies in the mode of goodness, he attains to the pure higher planets. So you cannot cheat the laws of nature. As we have discussed many times before, one in the mode of goodness, good people will be promoted to responsible positions and they would be given more facilities. So it is not that you mug up some formula, history, geography and you become powerful man and responsible post is given to you. You have to be a good person in knowledge. So not this bookish knowledge, real knowledge. So when we have real knowledge and we are a good person of good character, we are promoted to higher planet where comforts are many, many times more than on this planet. And there is great power and freedom. So great sages devotees, they live on those planets. So a person mode of goodness will have a very nice lex life. Very very happy. The more there is goodness, the least he would be disturbed by the changes of nature. And what is the fate of Rajasik people and Tamsik people? Rajasi pralayam gatwa karma sanghishu jayate tata pralinas tamasi mudha yonishu Jayat. When one dies in the mode of passion, he takes birth among those engaged in fruitive activities. So satvik people brahmanas. They don't want fruitive activities and they want to work for liberation. And other people who are Rajasik, they want fruitive, they want to enjoy the results of their activities. And when he dies in the mode of ignorance, he takes birth in the animal kingdom. Karmana sukritasyahu sathvikam nirmalam falam rajasastu falam dukam agyanam tamasa falam. By acting in the mode of goodness, one becomes purified. Works done in the mode of passion results in distress and actions performed in the mode of ignorance result in foolishness. So the whole world wants to understand why people are getting more and more distressed and they don't understand. You don't give weapons, they are in stress, you give weapons. There is another stress, you give people freedom. There is stress you don't give freedom there is another stress one country is in stress because people have more freedom. One country is in stress because people do not have freedom they are also revolting so nobody is happy. Free person is revolting and tight person he is also revolting so why people are in distress? So people do not read Bhagavad gita such simple instructions are given here one shloka and problem is solved. So we understood in the previous shloka what are the symptoms of mode of passion? Attachment sense, gratification never satisfied with their position always willing to increase have a good palatial house this is the mode of passion and what is the result of mode of passion? Rajasastu falam dukam nirmalam falam Satvikam the mode of Satoguna it purifies us two means but mode of passion falam dukam it creates only grief and distress in our life so thus we can understand. So we would have understood. Most of us are in the mode of passion because we have also symptoms which are mentioned and now what is the result of being in mode of passion? That is why most of us are in distress stress is always increasing so this would be the result. If you have a civilization where advancement means you are more advanced in the mode of passion you are more passionate find your passion and chase your passion then the result would be stress. There is no wonder why society is in stress so people if simply they read these two shlokas of Bhagavad gita they will be able to figure out why the stress is increasing in society there is no need of any artificial thing oh. Let us have four hour work week or let us give employees extra vacations or extra perks let us try to keep body also fit or do something XYZ no sir we have to understand mode of passion means we will remain under stress people think by being passionate and chasing my passion I would be happy. This is illusion. Happiness is in simple living in Sathwic lifestyle if a person is in mode of passion the end result would be stress. And thus because society is increasing in mode of passion we see earlier people were very simple but now people have more passion and thus there is more stress. This is the outcome. And what is the result of agyanam? Tamsik nature the result of Tamsik gun is agyan ignorance actions performed in the mode of ignorance result in foolishness by pious activities in the mode of goodness one is purified. Therefore the sages who are free from our illusion are situated in happiness. So thus all that we discussed all the sages were without any money. They are living in a hut which is below poverty line situation without any resources and they are very very happy always. Similarly, activities in the mode of passion are simply miserable. Prabhupada gives very nice example. Any activity for material happiness is bound to be defeated. For example, if one wants to have a skyscraper, so much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built. So many laborers have to take physical toil and we have to go to office and work very hard to raise money for that. And so much trouble people have to go through. So much human misery has to be undergone before a big skyscraper can be built. The financer has to take so much trouble to earn a mass of wealth. And those who are slaving to construct the building have to render physical toil. The miseries are there. The Bhagavad Gita says that in any activity performed under the spell of mode of passion, there is definitely great misery. There may be little so called mental happiness. I have this house or this money, but that is not actual happiness. That is a people in mode of passion are always frustrated and stressed out. Some so called illusory happiness. Oh, I have achieved so many certification. So much fame in society, status in society. This is illusory. This never makes us happy. But this is not actual happiness. And as far as the mode of ignorance is concerned, the performer is without knowledge and therefore all his activities result in present misery. So in mode of passion at least there is immediate happiness. I ate something very delicious rich food stuffs. Immediately there is some pleasure, although in the long term your health will get spoiled. So Rajeshik happiness immediately you did some sense gratification. You watched something very pleasant. But then long term there would be distress because of that activity. But immediately there is definitely some pleasure. Sexual activity immediately there is pleasure. Long term there is so much misery. But Tamsik activity means there is neither pleasure in the beginning or in the end. Satik activity is miserable in the beginning and very pleasurable at the end. So satvic activity will be troublesome. It will not be easy. Maintaining discipline is not easy. It becomes very troublesome. Every day I have to get up early in the morning. Every day I have to sleep early. Also every day I have to take cold water bath. Every day I have to chant 16 rounds. Oh, mind does not focus. No, you have to force the mind to hear the holy name. To think of Krishna every day I have to read. Initially it would be troublesome, but the end result would be nectarian. Then later even if somebody gives you money, you will not be able to leave such habits. So such activities will be troublesome in the beginning, but the end result is nectar. And Rajeshik activity gives you immediate pleasure. And long term you think, oh, I watched so many videos today, now my time is gone. Then you lament simply for that activity. And tamsik activity is neither pleasurable in the beginning or in the end. But an illusion person is not able to understand. This and his or her entire life is miserable. This is Tamagona satva Sanjayat Rajasoloba pramadhamoha bhavatogna from the mode of goodness, real knowledge develops. From the mode of passion, grief is mentioned here. That is actually greed, gr d greed develops from the mode of ignorance, foolishness, madness and illusion develop. Prabhupada explains since the present civilization is not very congenial to the living entities, krishna consciousness is recommended. Through Krishna consciousness society will develop the mode of goodness. So otherwise regular vanashrama system was there. Krishna consciousness is something extremely high. When people come to the mode of goodness, the mode of goodness is anyway very much required. So unless a person is knowledgeable, he will not be able to understand this topmost knowledge, topmost science of Krishna consciousness. Just like animal, if you preach them about God, animal is not even willing to listen. So those people all animal mentality, they will also not be able to understand. So society needs to be designed in such a way that gradually people are elevated towards simple living and high thinking. That is called satvoguna. And then when they are very much advanced in Satvoguna they might be able to perceive Krishna consciousness in association of pure devotee. But that vanashrama system is not in place now. That is why directly by following Krishna consciousness also person can get elevated from any stage. Either there is foolishness, madness and illusion. Person is very tamsik or person is very very greedy. He can directly take Krishna consciousness. And by Krishna consciousness satvaguna is byproduct it will come automatically. Knowledge will come automatically. So many not gradually wait to come to the platform of Satvaguna and then understand KC directly become Kerishna conscious and satvic nature will automatically be imbibed within us. But it is important. We should see. I have been following Krishna consciousness for such a long time. Have I become Sathwik or not? Because without becoming Satvik, without getting brahmanical qualities control of mind, control of senses being very very forgiving being very very clean inside and out having strong faith in the vedas this is the result of Satvoguna. If these things are not getting developed, we should ask the devotees prabhu, what is the mistake I'm doing in my spiritual practices? Why lust, greed is still prominent in my system? Why satvic activities are not developing, symptoms are not coming. So that is why Sri Lap Goswami recommends somehow or other one should come very quickly to Satvoguna. And then satvaguna means illumination. Then how to make further advancement? The path would be clear automatically. But in Rajaguna and Tamuguna person is rajasik means half mad, tamaguna means completely mad. So person will not be able to understand in which direction to go. But once we come to Satvoguna, then further direction is very very clear. All these confusions and doubts which are there this path is right or not? All the doubts are finished. In Satvoguna, person gets strong conviction. This is the right thing. Which I have to follow. So that is why we should follow Krishna consciousness nicely. And we should see whether I am advancing in Satvic qualities or not. Urduam Gachanti Satvastha madhya Rajasah Jaganyagona Vritista Adogachanti Tamasah those situated in the mode of goodness gradually go upward to the higher planets. So simply by our spaceship we cannot go to higher planets. Laws of nature will not allow us to do so. Those in mode of passion live on the earthly planets. And those in the mode of ignorance go down to hellish worlds. Nanyam Gunabhyakarta ram Yada drishtanupashyati gunabhyas Chaparam Veti Madhbhavam sodhi Gachati again, Krishna is repeating here the same thing what you mentioned in the beginning of this chapter. He will attain body of my nature. Here Krishna is repeating the same statement. He will attain my nature. When you see that there is nothing beyond these modes of nature in all activities and that the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all these modes, then you can know my spiritual nature. So just like in dream, we cannot find real personalities. Real personalities are living outside. In a similar fashion, god does not belong to these three modes of nature. So that is why God is found on the spiritual realm. So one should not get confused why I'm not able to see God here. Yes, because these are three modes of nature. This is a different platform. So when you see that there is nothing beyond these modes of nature in all activities and the Supreme Lord is transcendental to all these modes, then you can know my spiritual nature. And when we understand Krishna's spiritual nature, we are transferred to that nature. So thus this human form of life is simply designed so that we can develop perfect understanding about God. So Lord Krishna tells everyone is bewildered by these modes of nature. Just like people are bewildered by the computer game they will not be able to understand the reality outside. In a similar fashion, this world is simply a simulation of reality. If we are too much absorbed in this, we are not able to understand the reality. The origin of all reality, the supreme personality of Godhead. Gunata natitya trin dehi dehasamudhavan janmrityu jaradukha vimukto amritam ashnut now Krishna is telling one should not remain satisfied simply by being promoted to Satvaguna. One has to even transcend that when the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes he can become free from birth, death, old age and their distresses and can enjoy the nectar even in this life. So people are investing money now to preserve their bodies. They are expecting that consciousness is the result of combination of matter scientists will be able to discover in future. Thus they are investing so much for money. Thus you see, you work so hard and your money will be taken away by such people. And their bodies are being preserved very nicely. They're expecting after 100, 200, maybe some amount of time people would be able to figure out how to revive consciousness in this body. And then I will live again. People don't want to die. They want to live for a long time. But here Krishna is telling yes, you can become free from birth, death, old age and their distresses. All the concomitant miseries and you can enjoy nectar even in this life. People tell but this is post dated chakra. Prabhu, you are telling that if you follow Krishna consciousness nicely then after this death there would be no future death. Prabhupada tells us that is fact. Just like good students they also have to face exam. But then there is no exam. They pass the school. And ignorant students, they have to keep on repeating the same exam. They are not able to pass. They are not able to enter into a job and they don't get the proper facilities and comforts. So intelligent people have to write exam just once. Unintelligent they have to repeat many times till they are able to cross that exam. So ignorant living entities trapped in these three modes of nature helplessly acting under the spell of three modes. So we are acting under the spell of three modes of nature helplessly. If we are having so actually we are not having much freedom to choose. As we have discussed many times nature forces us if we are having tamuguna, tamugona forces us to destroy the things. rajoguna forces us to create things and Satvoguna forces us to maintain things. So helplessly as per the combination we are being pushed and pulled as a puppet on the stage. So if you want to have freedom then we have to transcend these three modes. So we can get freedom just in this life. This life is the last life. This death is the last death. If we are able to pass this examination called death if we are able to stay beyond the touch of these three modes at the time of death then there is no more death. It is just like once everyone has to write the exam. But even before death in this life vimukto amritam Ashnute the nectar can be enjoyed even in this life. So that is Krishna consciousness. You need not wait now we can perceive the results practically. We just have to absorb our mind, body and speech in the service of Krishna always. And then we'll be enjoying an extraordinary spiritual happiness even before death. So it is not a blind thing. Now we would be enjoying. And this is what gives a devotee strong faith. When you follow this process you actually perceive spiritual happiness. So when you are tasting some nice sweet then that is a proof. This sweet shop is very nice. And when you are not tasting you may speculate. This person may do adulteration. The milk is not pure. Something is not pure. But when you taste it, that is a proof. So similarly when you are tasting actually spiritual life then you don't want anything else. That is a proof of the process. And when a person can relish nectar in this life and get freedom from bird death and oldest disease gunan Etan atityatrin when the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes then he can become free from all these miseries and be happy even in this life. So how a person can transcend these three modes? Now we have discussed how a person can establish himself in these modes. So by practice, by determination we can do it just like by practice we build our muscles. We become strong in a similar fashion. By practice and by determination two things are mentioned. You can read the purport. So we have to be determined in human form of life we have little freedom. We can change our modes. But anyway after that also we'll be forced by the modes. But you can change in which mode you want to act. So if we are determined and if we practice two things are required. So by determination and practice we can come to the platform of Satvogana in a similar fashion. By determination and practice under the guidance of spiritual master we can transcend these three modes also. So what is that practice and what are the symptoms of a person? Now we discuss the symptoms of Satvik, Rajesik and Tamfik person. What are the symptoms of a person who is free? Can we figure out how does he walk, how does he talk? How we can make out he is a liberated man. All these things Krishna will describe in the concluding verses. And in the next class we'll be finishing this 14th chapter. So very important instructions Krishna would be giving what is the symptom of a fit person who is liberated now and henceforth also. So please do not miss. We will be concluding. So it's done for now. And now I'll be following the most important process of Krishna consciousness chanting of Hare Krishna Mahamantra which immediately transports us to the spiritual platform the most powerful way. Please take this process very sincerely. So if you do not take sincerely somehow let me chant some mantra. No, everything has to be done with attention. So please do with attention, do with respect, with knowledge that Krishna is not different from his name. So when we are chanting the names of Krishna then Krishna is personally present. Hare Krishna means Radha and Krishna are personally present. So with this faith if we chant then we are actually associating with Radha Krishna. We are requesting them. Please engage me in your service. So please take this thing as our life and soul. Chanting of Hari Krishna Mahamantra try to chant without any disturbance. Take proper rest. Take early rest. So that early morning with fresh mind continuously we can chant without any interruption. So our body has got two activities gross and subtle gross activities, gross disturbances. Four regulative principles we have to be very strict in following and subtle disturbances activities of the mind. Mind is jumping thinking here and there. Then again the Hare Krishna mantra cannot touch the spirit soul. So mind has to be very peaceful and the body also has to be very very controlled. Senses have to be regulated and then our chanting would become very very effective. So that is why to make the mind and body peaceful we follow all this process very nicely. Mind and body are disturbed because of sinful actions of the past. So when we worship, do deity worship? We worship the spiritual master. Then they take away our sins and our mind becomes peaceful. And there is no disturbance in the body. And we can very peacefully chant Hare Krishna Mahamantra. So that is why please follow. Everything has got great value. Deity worship is also very very important. It's very simple. In our house we can get up in the morning. You offer incense, flour and something water or milk or some fruits to Krishna to eat. And then you will see how your mind is becoming pacified day after day. Worship spiritual. Master Prabhupada. And you will notice how you are getting spiritual pleasure by doing this simple activity offering little flour and incense. But do it with humility. Do it understanding. We have no qualification in a begging mode. That Prabhupada. I have no qualification to worship you, Krishna. I have no qualification to worship you. But I have come. I have no other hope if you don't accept my service. So please accept my service in this begging mode. We should offer service. We should go and sit in front of deities and we should reveal our mind. If you have any problem, talk to the deities. Talk to the spiritual master. They are present in these forms and the more we are purified, we can realize their presence in the forms. So this is one very important element of deity worship to reveal our mind. So go and sit and talk to the deities. Reveal your heart. And this way we'll become purified and we'll be able to chant Hare Krishna Mahamantra advance nicely. So please try to follow all these elements very very nicely. Now let us chant and after this we'll take up questions.
