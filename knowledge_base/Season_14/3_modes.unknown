So Lord Krishna explains satvamrajas tama ITI guna Prakriti samhavah nibadnanti Mahabhu Dehe Dehina Mavyayam material nature consists of the three modes goodness, passion and ignorance. When the living entity comes in contact with nature, he becomes conditioned by these modes. Dehy means body and dehinam means living entity. Nimbad Nanti means it becomes conditioned. So once devotees proposed Srila Prabhupada to read a magazine because that magazine has covered some article about the movement. But Prabhupada was disinclined to read it and devotees pushed again that Prabhupada, can you please take a look? This magazine has produced article on us. Again Prabhupada did not show much interest. And when Prabhupada was requested for the third time, Prabhupada told oh, it's horrible. It makes the material world appear real. So the example given is just like you go to watch a movie and without any intention of crying, you at times cry seeing the movie, you start feeling oh, these scenes are real, these characters are real. And we get carried. And when we cry, what is the reason of crying? We see really some misery is there and actually those are just players on the stage playing a drama or some lights being thrown on the screen and some sound is being produced and we get carried away and we start thinking that that is reality. If we watch a horror movie, we automatically get scared. If we see somebody in the movies winning, we get automatically inspired. We feel very good. So this is when we know that this is false. We have purchased a ticket, I know it is not reality. They show a disclaimer also that it is purely coincidental. It is not reality what we are showing here. We know that we have come to watch a drama. All these are actors, nothing serious is going to happen over there. This is not reality. Even after knowing this is drama, still we get carried away and we start feeling that it is reality. So what to speak of the drama of this material world where we do not know it is reality. So we get carried away. That is why it is told in the scriptures gram me Kathana Koribe gram ekatana shonibe do not indulge in material talks, in material affairs. You will start feeling it is real. So of course, as much as is required for our job, our education, that much without showing any special interest, we have to take care, we have to be abreast with the affairs what are happening. But as much as is required, if at all, it is required. If not required, no need at all. It is very dangerous if we absorb our consciousness in these. Just like some colors falling on the screen and some sound makes us cry, makes us inspired, makes us fearful and that is what the people tell in the marketing world. Just like people without any intention to cry, they cry in the movie. Similarly without any intention of buying you can make them buy. So we are conditioned to act in a certain way and that is what they leverage. If you talk in this way, people will get induced to buy. They know how our body behaves. Our body is supposed to behave in a certain way. They predict this thing and try to leverage to their advantage. So does Prabhupada want the devotees? No, please don't show me all these things. So Prabhupada of course he will not be affected. But he's showing by his example to the disciples how much careful you should be while dealing in this material world. That is why when Prabhupada doing the leela of participating in the national movement he approached bhaktis Dant Maharaj for the first time in their first meeting. He argued who will listen your message? We are a dependent nation. So Bhaktisnath Maharaj told Krishna, consciousness is transcendental to temporary change of governments. Krishna consciousness is the urgent need. It cannot wait for change of government. So so many governments have changed. They have come and gone. Krishna had come many many times and he has disappeared. Still people are in stress. So that is the nature of this material world. Because people are in ignorance, they are always in stress. So change of governments and all these things will keep on coming and going. That is why it is mentioned in Bhagavatam. So many governments of the past, so many governments of future have also been predicted. Navanandan duja KashIt prapanan udharishati tesham abhavi jagati mauribukshanti vaikalao nanda dynasty will be there. Maura dynasty will be there. So many kings will come. These would be the names. These many years they are going to rule. All these things are predicted. So we should not get disturbed by this temporary affairs which are happening in the material world. So just like we have got nothing to do with the movie here very nicely Srila Prabhupada explains in the Purport the living entity because he is transcendental has nothing to do with this material nature. We are taking the thing seriously. Oh, these are the ways which will make me happy. These are the distresses I have to avoid in this material world. But actually living entity has got nothing to do with this material nature. Just like we have got nothing to do with drama or movie which is playing on the screen we have nothing to do. But if we enter the movie theater or drama theater we get conditioned by it. Then our response will depend upon the acting which is happening on the stage. Still because he has become conditioned by the material world he is acting under the spell of the three modes of material nature. So just like some energies, light and sound combination of these energies is controlling our emotions. In a similar fashion we are being controlled by these three modes of nature. Three energies. We have got nothing to do with this material world. Material energies. But when we come in contact with material nature. We become conditioned by these energies because living entities have different kinds of bodies in terms of different aspects of nature, they are induced to act according to that nature. This is the cause of the varieties of happiness and distress. So all the happiness and distress that we experience that depends on these factors. Just the three modes of nature we have got certain body and this body is induced to act in a certain way. Movie induces us to feel fearful, induces us to feel palpitations of the heart. Marketing people induce us to purchase their goods or services. So in a similar fashion, the material nature induces us to act in a certain way and the living entity, almost helplessly, it acts as per the dictates of material nature. And this is the cause. The conditioning given by the three modes is the cause of happiness and distress in our life. Just like if the body is that of a woman, then a woman body, it is destined to get attracted by a man, man body destined to get attracted by a woman. And because this attraction is present in the body when they come together tayor mithoride granthi mahu ata grahakshetra Sutapta Vitar, then you need graha, then you need a house to live and there would be children after that. So now, because you have got this body, you will be induced to act to find a partner who is having a different complementary body. And then again this body, these three modes will force us to work hard so that we can have a house. And then the result would be more children. And then you have to take care of children also for that you have to work extra hard. In this way suffering comes to us. So when the man and woman meet with each other, there is generation of pleasure and then they fight with each other, then there is generation of misery. In this way basis are modes which we acquire. We experience happiness or distress almost helplessly in our life. So as soon as the body takes birth that is why, as per the science of astrology, they can calculate nothing happens by chance. For example, if it is exam time and CBSE exams are going on and then you see some children are there on the street playing, they are not writing the exam or not preparing for the exam, then you understand they are going to fail and thus their future is bleak. A crude example I'm giving so the body should be manifest not on the street, but in the examination hall, writing the exam. If somebody is not doing that, that means the future is bleak or it could be very, very rich on the other side, they don't need to write such exams in a similar fashion. At which place on this planet the bodies manifest at what time basis that you can predict what is going to be the future. This is science. Just like I gave a crude example. So those people who are wise, they can predict this body has appeared in this location at this time, what is going to be the future? So that is why there is training in the Vedic culture. Don't follow the dictates of the body. Otherwise with the birth of body, our happiness and distress becomes fixed. We'll be induced to act in a certain way. We'll experience happiness and that happiness is not actually happiness, it is absence of misery. We'll be induced otherwise to have misery in our life. Helplessly we will act. Many times we feel why I'm getting angry? And later I realize why did I get angry and did so many other things? So nature induces us. That is why the training is guru kule vasandanto Guru Hitam first of all, you go to Gurukul and learn dantah control of the senses under the guidance of spiritual master and learn just how to satisfy the spiritual master and serve him like a menial servant. Nietzsche nietzsche means like a very fallen servant menial servant cleaning the room, cleaning the drains and collecting the woods from the jungle. Even though you could be son of king, but we have to act Nietzschevat. This is very very important. So the living entity is there in the material world because it wants to control everyone. That is a cause of all problem. Krishna is controller, but I want to take control. So Nietzsche tried to become servant. So son of king also learns how to become servant of the spiritual master. And in this way he tries to control his senses. So when the senses are controlled VA cho Vegam manasa Krodegam Jivba Vegam mudrapasta vegam then I can understand what is reality of this world. Otherwise we'll be forced to cry, forced to laugh. If there is laughter on that drama, then we will laugh. If somebody is crying, we cry helplessly. We are being dragged as per the dictates of material nature. So that is why the first step towards freedom coming to the platform of real knowledge is controlling the senses. That is why vaja Vegam, manasakro Devagam Jiva Vegamudhrapasta Vegam all the forces of the body should be controlled. This training is not there in the society today. That is why the religion is there any religion you follow? It does not matter. Every religion teaches some codes of control, self control. So if a person does not follow religion dharmayanahina pashubi samana then we are like animals, helplessly controlled by the nature. So religion trains us in the art of controlling our senses. The more we control, body is dictating. Oh, you get attracted, you do this thing and then so many miseries they come. Then you get attached to ten more people. Then there is family, then there are children, there are grandchildren. If there is difficulty with any of the family members, we are in difficulty. And one of the family members will be in difficulty always. So in that manner we are always in stress. And then like this hard work to maintain them, to raise them. And then child will take birth. And then hearing their soft voices we get happiness in the heart. Then the child grows up. Then they argue and then we feel distress in our heart. In this way happiness and distress is controlled. But if a person is advanced in the art of controlling the senses no body is dictating. Mind is dictating but no I will not follow the dictates. Then they stop dictating. Then even though body is designed to get attracted to certain kind of person but I will not get attracted. No entrance into family life. No need of maintaining a house no need of working hard no need of getting affected by some other people's happiness or distress. So this is also illusion. Simply bodily concept. I think some people belong to me. So their happiness we see as our happiness their distress we see as our distress. But why we are considering shastra's mentioned just one living entity born out of your body as your child. We produce so many living entities. We are producing bacteria, we are producing small worms. Sometimes they come out with the stool from the body. We are producing so many other germs from the body. Why we don't take them also as our children and maintain them? No because of bodily concept I think I am this body. I am human. So human only coming out of my body it belongs to me. So if some robbery happens at a neighbor's house we will not be disturbed. Or rather we'll be happy. Oh. Now I'm richer than him or her. Because I know that is not my money. But here we think it is my. This is illusory concept of life. So from birth somebody tells usile these are your parents. Then we'll start attaching his happiness and distress basis. The people he is being educated they are your family members. So the same soul is there in the body of the worms which come out of our body. But we don't treat them as children. Because I'm in bodily concept of life. So thus in this way when they are disturbed I get disturbed. But if a person knows how to control the senses then he will not be forced by the nature to undergo all these happinesses and distresses. So thus this training is very much required. In the beginning of life guru Kule Vasanthanto Guru hitam control the senses. And a person gets this qualification by serving Guru spiritual master Nietzsche like a menial servant. So if it is so easy that okay I understood. These modes are controlling me. In this way my destiny is fixed. Happiness and distress is fixed. Actually I've got nothing to do. And it is told in Bhagavatam also anarthopa, Shamam, Sakshad, Bhakti, Yoga, Madhokshaj all these material activities, material miseries they are actually superficial to us. So why can I not just stop watching movie? If all this distress happiness is because of this conditioning which I have acquired in contact. So the answer is given by Lord Krishna here. So why a person is not able to come out of this unlimited distress? It does not actually belong to him. It is because of these three gunas. So that is why Sanskrit is such a nice language. Guna is used for these modes of nature, these qualities. So guna means quality also and guna means rope also. So it is actually these qualities, these gunas which are acting as rope and binding us in this material world, not letting us free. So what are these three ropes? Lord Krishna describes in the following verses? Tatra Satbam nirmalatva Prakashakamanamayam sukha sangena badnati Ganasangayana Chanaga o sinless one anagha. In the mode of goodness being purer than others is illuminating and it frees one from all sinful reactions. Those situated in that mode, they develop knowledge but they become conditioned by the concept of happiness. So we will be experiencing the influence of these three qualities in our life. If a person is under the influence of satvaguna, so what is the quality of satvaguna? The mode of goodness is purer than others and it is illuminating. Just like sometimes the air is pure, it gives you good health. Sometimes air is impure, sometimes the water is pure, it will give you good health and digestion water could be impure, will give you diseases. Similarly satvic energy is pure, it gives you enlightenment and happiness. Rajasic Tamsik energies are impure. Rajasic energy little more impure. Tamsik energy most impure. But satvic energy is purer than others and it is illuminating. And it frees one from all sinful reactions. So human life is meant to free one from the sinful reaction. That is why on the sheet is told you fast. So when a person takes voluntarily discomfort as per the injunctions of the vedas, we purify ourselves. We are suffering only because of sinful reactions. People do not know this. They think if I improve my education, improve people around me material enjoyment, I'll be happy. And suffering always increases because they do not know the real cause of suffering. Real cause of suffering is sinful action. That's it. We break the laws of nature. So we are suffering. We are all children of God. Father doesn't want children should suffer. So God does not want us to suffer. But we break the laws of nature, put other living entities into trouble, then we suffer. Then what can be done? So that is why in human form of life we should try to get free from the reactions of those sinful acts. Just like now we have some penalty system. You have broken this law. You put give penalty and then you will be freed. Otherwise imprisonment. So in that manner we are supposed to undergo tapasya. By that I can purify myself. But people do not know all these things now. So if a person is satvic, satvic nature frees run from sinful reactions. Destiny will not be able to control the person if he's satvic. Those situated in that mode develop knowledge but they become conditioned by the concept of happiness. So satvic energy is pure. A person is illuminated, develops knowledge. But this is also a rope. Why? Because when we have knowledge in this material world, then we follow the laws of nature and we are happy. And they become conditioned by the concept of happiness. And thus they don't inquire further about spiritual life. Prabhupada explains the living entities conditioned by material nature are of various types. One is happy, another is very active and another is helpless. So sattvic person would be happy. So how to understand material world? We tell Dukhalyam Krishna has made it full of stress. And how the sattvic person is happy. So this happiness is absence of misery. When the exams are over, child is happy. So nothing good has happened to him. Only misery has gone away. In a similar fashion, when the harassment of sinful reactions is taken away, then a person is happy absence of misery. So thus a satvic person is happy. Another is very active. Those who are controlled by mode of passion, they are very active. We think if I'm very active, if I work very hard, very efficient, then will be happy. It is foolishness. Active person is not happy unless he's active. For the service of Krishna, if he is active on material platform, it will make him stressed. So one person is happy, Satik person, another person is active, passionate person, rajasik person and Tamsik person is helpless. We feel sometimes helpless automatically it happens. I'm being dragged, I'm being pushed into some activity. This helplessness happens because of Tamsik nature. All these type of psychological manifestations are the causes of the entity's conditioned status in nature. How they are differently conditioned is explained in this section of Bhagavad Gita so very nicely. Krishna will explain now in this chapter how the living entities controlled by material nature. And now they are helplessly. As soon as we take birth, our happiness and distress is fixed. How much ever we work hard, we cannot change it. Without coming to Krishna consciousness it is fixed. The mode of goodness is first considered. The effect of developing the mode of goodness in the material world is that one becomes wiser than otherwise conditioned. A man in mode of goodness is not so much affected by material miseries and he has a sense of advancement in material knowledge. And the representative type is the Brahmana who is supposed to be situated in the mode of goodness. This sense of happiness is due to understanding that in the mode of goodness one is more or less free from sinful reactions. Actually in the Vedic literature it is said that mode of goodness means greater knowledge and a greater sense of happiness. So that is why such people take to the tasks of philosophers. They are just satisfied to cultivate knowledge. What is reality, what is this world? So they become philosophers, they become educators, they become poets not educators of today. Today educators are also shudras because they take salary. So these people do not want salary. Just somehow body should be maintained. They are satisfied in cultivating knowledge. But such people also because they are relatively happy they don't endeavor to come out of this material world. And they repeatedly may take birth as poets, philosophers and educators. Brahmana is supposed to belong to that category of satvic person. Next category is rajasik raju ragatma kamvidrishna sangha Samudh bhavam tanibadnathi kante karma sange raju rag atma kamvidhi rag means strong attachment or lust. The mode of passion is born of unlimited desires and longings, O son of Kunti. And because of this one is bound to material fruitive activities. So what is this mode of passion? We all know passionate people, isn't it? Passion? They tell we have to become passionate. The mode of passion is characterized by the attraction between man and woman. Woman has attraction for man and man has attraction for woman. This is called the mode of passion. And when the mode of passion is increased one develops the hankering for material enjoyment. He wants to enjoy sense gratification. For sense gratification. A man in the mode of passion wants some honor in the society or in the nation. And he wants to have a happy family with nice children, wife and house. These are the products of the mode of passion. As long as one is hankering after these things, he has to work very hard. Therefore, it is clearly stated here that he becomes associated with the fruits of his activities and thus becomes bound by such activities. In order to please his wife, children and society and to keep up his prestige, one has to work. Therefore, the whole material world is more or less in the mode of passion. Modern civilization is considered to be advanced in the standards of mode of passion. Formerly the advanced condition was considered to be in the mode of goodness. So formerly who were advanced, who were respected the most? Educators, philosophers, brahmanas. So teacher was having the greatest respect in the society. So we can consult our fathers or grandfathers. They would tell us teachers were highly, very highly respected. Because teachers were Brahmanas saints who would externally appear like beggar. Very thin body, very condition of much depravity. But they were the most respected. The more a person can minimize his needs of life the more he can fall below poverty line, the more he would be respected. They were practicing, not forced, but voluntarily. Person accepts poverty, he practices how to remain dependent upon Krishna. Such people were called Brahmanas and they were greatly respected. Kings would take their advice. Kings would leave their throne and worship the brahmanas. This was the culture. The more a person was advanced in satvoguna those people were respected in the society. Not everyone can do that. But they were knowing these people are advanced. But now this understanding is finished. Now we think anybody who can make money he is advanced. And they would be interviewed and they would be guiding the society. They would write columns. They would become advisors of the government, the greatest capitalists. But such a person is foolish who wants to make more and more money. Because they don't understand simple thing. Money does not make you happy. Happiness is in satvaguna. Money will create troubles for you. So this mode of passion is characterized as it explained in the beginning between attraction. It arises from attraction between man and woman. So the more we are attraction for the opposite gender we can understand. The more we are in the mode of passion the more there is lust in the body, the more there is passion. And then a person has to work very hard to maintain family. So Brahmanas would live in Gurukul. And generally they will continue and take Sannyas. Some of them will come and have a married life also. But usually they will continue for sannyas life. But mode of passion, this person cannot live alone. So they need to have family, children. And he has to work hard to please them and to maintain status, prestige in the society. They want honor. People should respect me, honor me. So he does not understand anybody who's thinking he is the body. That is madness. So who cares for respect given by the mad people? So just like a madman sometimes you will see mad people controlling the traffic on the streets. He's thinking he's a traffic police. Actually he's a madman. Similarly if I think I'm man, woman, rich, poor, president, vice president, laborer clerk then that is called madness. This is simply designation of this body. We are different. So a person gets into this concept anything. So other people also should respect me, give me honor. This itself is madness. If you are expecting any honor in this world and working hard for that. So a Sathik person understands whole world is mad. He does not care at all about this thing. He understands this world is temporary. So formerly people advanced in Satvoguna. Illumination, knowledge, simplicity, sense, control. They were given most respect. Today people of passion. Mode of passion. Because entire society is passion. If there is election in jungle they would obviously select lion as their king. They would never vote for the greatest politician. They would always choose animal. In a similar fashion. For passionate people a passionate man is hero. So if there is no liberation for those in the mode of goodness mode of goodness Satik people also they don't get liberated. So then what to speak of people who are Rajasik? So such people always they work very hard and they always remain in anxiety. Then what is the situation of third category? Tamsik tamaswagyana jamvidhi Mohanam sarvadebadnathi Bharata so human beings should be passionate. But today's civilization is so nice he is being dragged into Tam sick nature also. O son of Bharat. The mode of ignorance causes the delusion of all living entities. The result of this mode is madness, indolence and sleep which bind the conditioned souls. In this verse Prabhupada explains two is used. You can read the first line. Tamas to Agyana jam with thee. So first mode. Second mode is explained. But this Tamas is very dangerous. Two means but there is something specific so but is used. But please be very very cautious of this Tamas. This means that the mode of ignorance is a very peculiar qualification of the embodied soul. The mode of ignorance is just the opposite of the mode of goodness. In the mode of goodness by development of knowledge, one can understand what is what. So even if we have to understand material world nicely, we have to be in the mode of goodness. So in the mode of goodness person can very very easily understand what is this life all about? How I am not the body, what is the aim of life. But in mode of ignorance it is opposite. Everyone under the spell of mode of ignorance becomes mad. And a mad man cannot understand what is what. Instead of making advancement, one becomes degraded. The definition of mode of ignorance is stated in Vedas. Under the spell of ignorance one cannot understand things as it is. For example, everyone can see that his grandfather has died and therefore he will also die. Man is mortal. The children that he conceives will also die. So death is sure. Still people are madly accumulating money and working very hard all day and night not caring for the eternal spirit. So I am going to get down from this train. But I don't care about my eternal work. I get involved with the people I meet in the train coach. This is called madness. My grandfathers have passed away. My children also will pass away. This temporary arrangement we have just like the travelers meet in a lounge in a restaurant and they carry on with their journeys. But in Tamsik, because of this thamas we don't understand. We get carried away by the temporary reality and work very hard to maintain it. Although I know it cannot be maintained, I put all my so anyway we'll discuss it further. So just like a person drinks, when a person is drunk highly thumbsick, then he cannot understand. He or she cannot understand what is what a drunkard or under intoxication or when we sleep. This is Tamsik. I cannot understand even what is happening in the material world, material reality. So this is very dangerous Tamsik. In their madness they are very reluctant to make advancement in spiritual understanding. Such people are very lazy when they are invited to associate. For spiritual understanding, they are not much interested. So when we go to preach to distribute books we see some people don't show interest usually thamsik people inclination will not come just like a crow will not be inclined to go to clean places. Always attracted to house fly and crows filthy places pig they will go they are allergic to clean places you put them in clean place, they will leave that they are repulsive to that. So if we have tamuguna so much in our body, we will not be attracted for spiritual life they are not even active like the man who is controlled by the mode of passion. Thus another symptom of one embedded mode of ignorance is one sleeps more 6 hours of sleep is sufficient for us but those who are in mode of passion, they sleep 8 hours, 10 hours or even 12 hours so much they sleep. So anybody Prabhupada explains who sleeps more than six to 7 hours should be considered in a diseased condition of material life. So one should try to come to the mode of satmaguna by spiritual practices and thus mitigate it. So nowadays people are very fond of because they are having passion they have to work hard but when there is weekend 10 hours, 12 hours keep on sleeping this is called tamugun such a man appears to be always dejected. We see some people dejected. So those people who are under, intoxication, they sleep a lot, lazy, they will always be dejected, energy less, lifeless, depressed and is addicted to intoxicants and sleeping. These are the symptoms of a person conditioned by the mode of ignorance. Now, what are the effects of these modes? Satvam sukesh Sanjayati raja karmani bharata gyana mavrityatutamaha pramade sanjayatyuta the mode of goodness Prabhupada explained the purport already conditions one to happiness, passion conditions him to the fruits of action ignorance to madness so this is our conditioning? Conditioning? Means the control which is exerted by material nature. So because we are happy, we don't want to advance. So sometimes it can happen to us. We practice spiritual life nicely earlier we are in distress, so we take to spiritual life. But by following the spiritual principles, we become happy. And then that impetus. Initially, we are very much spirited to make spiritual advancement. We are very strict. But when we become happy in this world, we become little. Loose. We slacken our efforts for spiritual advancement. So Prabhupada told when he gave one of the first initiations. Usually we tend to slacken our efforts after sometimes spiritual life because we get conditioned by happiness. But we should continue. Our efforts with great intensity and rigor. But this happiness is very dangerous. Material happiness conditions living entity. He stays in material world only and happiness cannot continue for a long time. Just like if you are living in a location where there is, let's say, COVID, dengue or some other disease. You might be fit now, but anytime you can contact virus and you also will fall diseased in a similar fashion. Material world is full of rajoguna and Tamuguna. Even though we might be Sathwick now anytime we can be influenced by rajoguna Tamuguna and we can degrade to lower animal species. So happiness conditions. A living entity mode of passion conditions comes to fruit of action. I want this much money from my job or my business or I want this name and fame. Fruits of activity. I get conditioned by that. And I'm controlled. My actions are controlled basis the fruits of my action. An ignorance person is conditioned by madness. He cannot understand at all. Mad person. He also remains in the material world. Rajasthamash chabi Bhuya satbam bhavati bhaarata rajasthatvam tamash chayeva tamas tatha. Sometimes the mode of passion becomes prominent defeating the mode of goodness. O son of Bharat. And sometimes the mode of goodness defeats passion. And at other times the mode of ignorance defeats goodness and passion. In this way there is always competition for supremacy. So when we get up in the morning we feel fresh. If at all we are getting up in the morning we'll feel fresh. When we take bath, we feel fresh. When we evacuate we feel fresh. So when the dirt is going from the body so these are the times of Satvaguna. We feel happy. So that time mode of goodness is predominant. It defeats passion and ignorance. And then when the sun rises we become indulged in activities. As some of the devotees shall prabhu morning sadh naidu nicely. But when I go to office, I do not know what happens. I feel so much of energy and get forced into work. So much of intense passion develops. Yes, that is a nature. In the daytime there is so much of passion in the nature. And thus people work very hard. And then other times we feel sleepy. We are forced to feel sleepy. At that time Tamuguna is predominating us. So in this way the three modes of nature they take their dominance. Nighttime Tamagona is predominant. Morning time satyaguna is predominant. Daytime rajoguna is predominant. So there is competition for supremacy. So this prominence of mode of nature is manifested in one's dealings, activities, eating etc. We can analyze that. Krishna will explain further. Satvik person he will have Satvic food. Rajeshi person will have different food. Tam sikh person will have meat eating intoxicants putrids and such stale food. So by eating, by talking, by behavior we can judge whether a person is in Satvuna, Rajaguna and Tamuguna. But by practice if one wants so in other species of life we are helpless. We cannot come out of these ropes, these gunas. But in human form of life we have got slight independence. If that independence we use rightly we will get more freedom. Then that increased freedom. If used rightly, our freedom increases further. In this way we advance in Satvaguna. So by practice we can develop goodness or we can develop mode of passion also. Or we can develop mode of ignorance also. It depends. So this choice is given in human form of life. So if one is determined then he can make advancement in satvoguna. Determination is required. So we have to be very very determined. We should try to come to Satvoguna. And once we come to Satbaguna then we have to transcend Satvoguna. We have to come to shuddha Satvoguna. That is called vasudev stage. So please try to understand. A person in the mode of passion is a person in the mode of ignorance. Anyway we understand. Person who is sleeping, he cannot understand reality. Person under intoxicants or anesthesia cannot understand reality. Person mode of passion can understand sometimes. But so many desires are pulling him in different directions. He or she cannot clearly understand. But a person is Satvaguna, he can understand. And thus Satvaguna is very favorable. Although it conditions us, it is favorable for spiritual advancement. So we should try to come to Satvaguna. And then we should try to surpass even Satvaguna and come to shuddha Satvaguna. So just like the knowledge comes in Satvaguna, when there are no desires pulling us in different directions, person can analyze, understand what is what. And then if he implements this then he comes to shuddhasata vasudev state. On vasudev state we can understand Vasudev. Vasudev is Krishna's father. So Krishna's father gives birth to Krishna in a similar fashion on Vasudeva's state. Pure spiritual, pure sattvic platform. In material world pure Satvik platform does not exist. Satvaguna always is mixed by rajoguna and Tamuguna. So when we are situated on spiritual pure satvik platform then we can understand Krishna. Till then we have to have patience. Just like a small child he has patience. Parents tell no, you will not understand. You will understand later. So they understand. Unless he grows up there is no chance. Similarly unless we grow up in our consciousness. Prabhupada tells, when you try to understand spiritual life you are not able to understand anything. Immediately some people ask Prabhupada in the lecture Prabhupada, it is easy to understand that I am not the body. But it is not easy to understand that I am not the mind. I am spirit, soul different from mind. How to understand that? So Prabhupada told Prabhupada did not endeavor much to explain. Prabhupada simply told don't try to understand everything in a single day. So we have to have patience. So delivery of a child takes nine months. How much of a eager a person as child cannot take birth before that? In a similar fashion, patience is another qualification of spiritual life. We have to be patient. We have to work very hard. See how we are evolving in Satvoguna coming to shuddha Satvaguna. And when we are in shuddha Satvaguna not influenced by passion and ignorance, lust and greed in the heart, then we will be able to understand God. Till then we have to wait we have to have patience. So further description of these Gunas Lord Krishna is mentioning again very important instructions that we will discuss in the next class. So Chanchala Patiprava was very nicely explaining with a simple analogy being conditioned by the Satvaguna, rajoguna and Tamuguna. Just like a person who is going in his car. Person who is Tamsik, he does not know. He's in ignorance. So in ignorance a person does not know the traffic rules. Person does not know the speed limit and other things. And thus he will be punished and he will suffer. In this way a person mode of ignorance suffers because of lack of knowledge. Person who is passionate, passionate driver. Even though he knows traffic rules he will jump the traffic signal. He will break the speed limit. Or he will meet with an accident, hit another person. He knows the traffic rules. But because of this unlimited longings, desires of enjoyment he also meets suffering in life. And what is Satvik person? Satvik person has complete knowledge. And he is not having strong material desires of driving very fast and all these other things. So he will drive very carefully. He will not hit anybody. He will stop properly at the red signal, drive on the green signal. He will follow the speed limits and other rules and regulations. So this person will not be disturbed by the traffic police. This person would be happy. But if this person also does not know where am I supposed to go then there is no use of simply driving the car nicely. It is useless. So thus unless a person comes to the point of understanding of Krishna everything is useless. So we should not become very happy. Those people who are very advanced in knowledge senses are very nicely controlled. I have no desires. But have you understood Krishna? Have you surrendered completely to Krishna? So if it has not happened complete surrenderance to Krishna knowledge of Krishna then it is useless. Person has driven his car very nicely entire day. He did not reach home or office. Then what is the use of that driving? That is useless activity. So in this way we can understand the conditioning by Satvaguna, rajoguna and Tamuguna. So Srila Rupa Goswami mentions in Shamrita by all means one should try to come to Satvaguna. Satvaguna is illuminating. So at night you might be scared. You may mistake a rope as a snake or snake as a rope. And we do not know where is path, where is ditch. We will suffer falling the road. But when there is sun very clearly we see what is snake, what is row, where is path, where is drain, where is ditch. And thus we are traversing a very safe path. So when there is Satvaguna then automatically further guidance comes what to do next and how to make spiritual advancement. But if we do not come to Satvaguna life is very very dangerous. So we have to follow the rules and regulations. So Varnashrama system is built. So that person can gradually come to Brahmanical platform. But now there is no Varnashrama. But there is no need to be sorry. We have even advanced process of following this very beautiful process explained by Lord Krishna of Bhakti Yoga and the Bhagavad Gita. So if we follow the rules and regulations given by the spiritual master so we should train ourselves not to follow the dictates of mind and body. Otherwise we'll fall into rajoguna and Tamuguna. Follow the dictates of the spiritual master. The more we are following rules and regulations of the spiritual master the more we are coming to Satbaguna. And then the path will automatically be clear. All the confusions will go away from the mind. So I request please be very very strict in following rules and regulations. Honor only krishna Prasadam get up early in the morning, take bath in cold water two to three times in a day associate with the devotees, read every day, do kirtan morning and evening in this way try to maintain yourself don't work very very hard for material affairs. Anyway money, happiness, distress name infamy even if it affects us, it is fixed in life. So in this way try to remain very satvic, very regulated and then automatically everything would be clear. We'll discuss more in the upcoming session for now we will chant we will follow to the most powerful practice of coming to Satvuna immediately and that is hare Krishna. Hare Krishna krishna Krishna Hare hare hare Ram hare Ram ram ram.
