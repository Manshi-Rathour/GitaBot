Gunata, Nati, Tia, Trin, Dehi, Dehasamad, Bhavan, Janmritiyo, Jaradu, Khair, Vimukto, Miritam, Ashnute when the embodied being is able to transcend these three modes he can become free from birth, death, old age and their distresses and can enjoy the nectar even in this life. So we understood how spiritual life is not a postdated check. You can join nectar at every step. Every moment will be full of bliss even in this life. Before we leave the body we just have to transcend the three modes of nature spiritualize our body take it out of control of three modes. So now we see in the news so much violence is happening which is a norm in the material world. And more so in Yuga Kalyuga is the age of quarrel and hypocrisy. Nobody agrees with anybody. There are fights even within the family. Otherwise this disagreement was rare. It was happening sometime in earlier ages. But now it is rampant everywhere. And when we see such sufferings now media is crying and politicians are trying to figure out how to stop this violence. Sorry. People are worshipping very nicely in a place of worship. And then for no reason such innocent people are killed. There is a bomb and hundreds are massacred. And then somebody's teaching somebody comes and shoots you. So people are telling oh, this country is the reason this country is sponsoring the terrorists. And somebody is telling this government policy is bad. Because of this we are suffering. Somebody is calculating XYZ so many things they are doing. But ultimately in the morning Srila Prabhupada was explaining how his Guru Maharaj was as we have discussed before also when Srila Prabhupada met his Guru Maharaj he also presented this cause of freedom of the nation. We need to make our nation free. Then only somebody will hear our message. People are suffering because of this. So bhakti sdnan Maharaj told actually all the suffering. He was very very firm in this. And that is strictly in line of disciplique succession from Krishna. This is the actual knowledge, absolute truth. We think that there are so many problems in my life because of so many factors which we cannot calculate. But he told the vedas are telling as we saw in the first session of Ishopanishad. Punasya punamadaya puna meva vashishate om punamida punamidam poona punamuda chatea punamidam. God is complete and this world is also complete. And there is complete arrangement for our maintenance and happiness. So any incompleteness that we feel in our life it is because of incomplete understanding of the complete whole means incomplete understanding of God, the absolute truth. So actually there are no problems of life. We may have various issues. Some temporary issues like some temporary violence which we have seen is happening now or some perpetual issues like diseases and poverty. These are also actually artificial. These are man made we have created. So this is the knowledge which Bhagavad Gita gives us. Nobody has clue about this. Knowledge but only Bhagavad Gita tells us as we have seen in previous chapter 13 chapter so very beautifully lord Krishna explained the changes will happen in the material nature as per its plan. Winters will come, spring will come, autumn, summers, rainy season all this will come and go. Creation will happen, destruction will happen all these things will happen as per the plan of nature. But happiness or distress our experience of happiness and distress that simply depends upon living entity. We are the creators of our happiness and distress. So many movies will be played in the cinema hall in the multiplex as per their schedule. Sometimes it would be action movie. You go and you come in mode of passion. Sometimes it would be horror movie. You become very tamsik. You get fearful. Sometimes it could be Krishna's movie. You become spiritual by watching that. It depends at which time you want to enter the multiplex and whether you want to see or not. It is your. It depends upon you. In a similar fashion material nature will show us different faces that will happen but happiness and distress totally depends upon us. And people do not know this. And this is because of again Godlessness lacking the basic sense that God is the creator and why God will make the living entity suffer god is very very kind. He is the ultimate father. We are all children of God. He loves us very much like we love our own children. And Srimad Bhagavata mentions when Duryodhana so Duryodhana was rogue of the highest order he wanted to disrobe Draupadi, pure devotee of Krishna make her naked in the assembly kill the pure devotees of Krishna Pandavas who were very very simple brothers they were willing to give up their entire kingdom. These are my relatives only now my brothers arjuna was telling to Krishna let them enjoy we are satisfied with just five villages. So Lord Krishna told them he went on their behalf that please give them five villages because they are Kshatriya kshatriya cannot do any other thing. Kshatriya is meant to do administration give protection to the people. So as per their mind and body the king needs to engage them properly. So they are Kshatriyas. At least give them small villages to administer, to rule. But when they told this is also not possible then there was war and in that also Arjuna is telling I don't want to fight does not matter village I can live by begging. So he was such a rogue he was not willing to give even few villages what to speak of village? He told I will not give land equal to the tip of needle also. And then so many life attempts were made and Draupadi was insulted. So Krishna could not tolerate harassment of his pure devotee. So when Duryodhan his spine broken he was lying on the verge of death and ordinarily if we find any such rogue we become very happy seeing this situation very nice. He should suffer more. But Lord Krishna was not happy to see Duryodhan in that situation. So Bhagavatam explains sometimes people tell God is sadist, he takes pleasure. So no, that is very wrong understanding. Just like it is wrong to call parents sadist. They don't take pleasure in beating the children, punishing the children. But when the child does an activity which is harmful for his own self or for others, then such punishment parents are forced to give. They don't like it. But it is important for correction of child. In a similar fashion when we force Krishna to give trouble to us. So in Bhagavatam it is mentioned god prays from our conscience in the heart. Whenever we do any wrong thing, our conscience begs. Krishna begs through our good conscience, please do not do this activity. But when we stop listening the voice of our conscience, then what Krishna can do? So he begs from the heart. He has given us conscience, he has given us scriptures. He comes and pleads do not do this. But despite this, if we give harm to other living entities we have a civilization of maintaining slaughterhouses. We are killing our own brothers and sisters in different dresses and we eat them. Can anybody eat their own brothers and sisters? That is meat eating. Our brothers and sisters are in different dresses. So how Krishna can tolerate? And despite that, even after giving that punishment, krishna does not take pleasure. Because ultimately we are his children suffering under ignorance. That is why the greatest service to Krishna is preaching this message to others. When a devotee risks and tries to take. Because as soon as you try to spread this message, ignorance is bliss. And it is told it's a folly to be wise. Where ignorance is bliss, if you are wise when people are foolish, they will hang you, they will persecute you, punish you. And thus all the great preachers of religion or many of them they have faced great persecution in the hands of public, ignorant public. So Krishna becomes very very happy when somebody is trying to help give this message to the suffering humanity. So Krishna is not happy even though a person who deserves to be punished is being punished. So God is very kind. So people are venting out anger against different immediate reasons for the punishment. But this is ignorance. We have to understand. God has designed this world. He wants everyone to be happy. We are suffering only because of ignorance. We break the laws of nature and thus we create our own suffering. So it is very important to realize ourselves in our life. We should just try to become very firmly established in this fact and help others also realize that we are suffering only because we have broken the laws of nature. If this terrorist group does not bomb, another terrorist group will bomb. Or if there is no bombing, then there is disease. Nature will create COVID. And you will die because of that unexpected thing. And so many people died because of it. So nature has its ways and means. So Krishna told Arjuna, I have already killed everybody. You do not want to fight. Do not think they will go alive from this battlefield. But if you want the credit, then you fight. Otherwise nobody is going to go alive from this battlefield. I have killed both the sides except you, the Pandavas. So in that way nature has already decided punishment will be given. The more we try to lord over nature, greater punishment would be given. So we have to understand simply if we understand one thing simply if we understand, realize the presence of God god has created everything. Then everything is clear. God is in control. Nobody can bypass the laws of nature. So I am suffering because I have done something bad. So what is that bad thing? Then? A person should be inquisitive what is good and what is bad. How to understand the instruction, the laws of God? How to follow it? But because of this Godlessness, people are creating laws, cursing, countercursing. They are vendetta politics, media and so many things. United nations. So much discussion happens. And Prabhupada told it is like assembly of barking dogs. Dogs may keep on barking at each other. Their problems and living status will remain the same. So assembly of barking dogs when aim of life is eating, mating, sleeping, defending which dog is also doing what is the difference? Then we remain suffering like a dog. So this very important knowledge is missing from society. And the suffering is increasing. The more people become Rajasik and Thamsik the more suffering will increase. And people will not even realize that this is suffering. I can avoid it. Here Krishna is telling as we can read very clearly jan, Vimritu, Jara, Dukkhair we can solve Janmriti and Jara. Old age, disease, death can be solved. But in ignorance people think oh, this is natural, that will happen. What can be done? So it can be solved. So the question arises now that I have broken some laws of nature. So what is the way out, how to do it? And what is the situation of person who has surpassed all these laws of nature? He has risen above the three gunas. So this is the question which Arjuna is asking. So this is a question which we are supposed to ask. Not the question of which is a good company which can give me good career. We think good company will make me happy. So we recently have one devotee who has moved here. And he has cracked one of the toughest exams in the country. And no sooner did he come to this city, Mumbai. He told this pathetic place I'm not happier, I want to go to another place. I want to go for further studies or change my place. He's unhappy every other day keeps on reporting he's unhappy but thousands of people on LinkedIn they have congratulated that you have done very nice and it is so good so we were just discussing just see this is Maya. So people are congratulating you and he was telling I am the first among my immediate and extended family who has come out of the town and got into such big town and good job so he is held in great recognition position of respect in his circle and so many people have congratulated think he would be happy. He thought he would be happy but when he came here he is not happy. So this is simply simply ignorance. Actually society is in complete ignorance. So we are very expert in trying to find out a good job for us. How to crack the right examination discussions on happening, how to plan the right strategy to crack the exam, which book to refer, which tutorial, which online course, which offline teacher mentor we should go to, how should we find a right spouse? How to have a nice relationship. We think if somehow I can have a nice relationship, I would be happy. Relationship can never be nice here because we are not here for relationship we are here for self interest. That is the nature of all the living entities who do not love Krishna. A person cannot love anybody who does not love Krishna and one who loves Krishna, he loves everybody because everyone is part and parcel of Krishna. So there is no question of any good relationship here because we are self interested anybody who satisfies me so where is a question of any satisfaction in such an attitude? If I find out which is the best place to live, best city to have pollution free and good cost of living and no traffic and people want to figure out no corruption, no pollution and then in this way people are trying to figure out how to become happy but they do not know this is all ignorance. One cannot be happy unless one surrenders to God unless one surpasses the three modes of nature. So this is the question we should ask not all these questions even if we get answer of all these questions people who give the answer, they themselves are not satisfied but these questions if we get answer to we will be completely satisfied. Swarajan asks oh my dear Lord, by what symptoms is one known who is transcendental to those modes? Krishna has told you become transcendental you solve birth, let, old age, disease all problems. So what are the symptoms? Many times people ask us question that how to understand somebody who is liberated? Prabhu, are you liberated? So Arjuna is asking same intelligent question what are the symptoms of one who is liberated transcendental to those modes? What is his behavior and how does he transcend the modes of nature? It's a very important question and let's see what Lord Krishna has to answer. Now, Lord Krishna is giving answer to these three questions sri Bhagavanu VA cha Prakasham chaprathimcha mohammedava nadwesti sam pravritani nanavrita shati udasi navadasi no gunariona vichalyat gunavar tanta yovatish tati NanGate samadhukasukaswasta samaloshtashmakanchanah tulip priya priyodhiras tulyanindatma sanstutihi mana pamana yostulyas tulyo mitra pakshayo sarv parityagi gunatita sahochyate. The blessed Lord said he who does not hate illumination, attachment and delusion when they are present nor longs for them when they disappear. Who is seated like one unconcerned being situated beyond these material reactions of the modes of nature who remains firm, knowing that the modes alone are active, who regards like pleasure and pain and looks on a clawed a stone and a piece of gold with an equal eye who is wise and holds praise and blame to be the same who is unchanged in honor and dishonor who treats friend and foe alike who has abandoned all fruitive undertakings. Such a man is said to have transcended the modes of nature. So Lord Krishna is explaining here there are three states of consciousness. When a person is satvik then he will have illumination. When a person is Rajasic mode of passion. He or she has attachments here. And when we are tamsik, then we are under delusion. So Srila Prabhupada very nicely explains when a living entity stays in this material world embodied by the material body, it is to be understood that he is under the control of one of the three modes of material nature when he is actually out of the body, then he's out of the clutches of material modes of nature. But as long as he is not out of the material body, he should be neutral. He should engage himself in the devotional service of the Lord so that his identity with the material body will automatically be forgotten when one is conscious. Of the material body he acts only for Sense Gratification but when one transfers the consciousness to Krishna sense gratification automatically stops one does not need this material body and he does not need to accept dictations of the material. Body the qualities of the material modes in the body will act but as spirit soul the self is aloof from such activities how does he become aloof? He does not desire to enjoy the body nor does he desire to get out of it. Thus transcendentally situated the devotee becomes automatically free. He need not try to become free from the influence of the modes of material nature. So the key to transcend the influence of modes of material nature is one should not try to leave this body neither one should try to enjoy this body remain completely indifferent to the three modes of nature. So as long as we are in this body the body will act under control of one of the modes. You have gotten up in the morning and you have taken bath we feel very fresh illuminated senses are under control brain is sharp and clear we are able to think rightly and the materialists also they recognize that is why they tell if any work is there which requires brainstorming and focus then I do it early in the morning because down the day when we go then our sense control becomes very loose. Everyone recognizes at night the sense control is loose. Mind control is loose. So any person who is saying he will be able to see these effects on our body So sometimes we will be having illumination. Other times we will be having attachment. We have certain body. We will have different attachment. Somebody would be attached to eating sweet somebody would be attached to eating meat. So these inclinations can be there in the body and delusion Everyone has to sleep. So that is called tamaguna. In tamaguna, we are in delusion. Either I'm dreaming of something or I'm completely unconscious. So our body passes through these modes. As long as we are having this body, it will be under the control of one of these modes. So Lord Krishna mentions here when they are present a liberated person who has transcended the modes. He does not hate. He Does Not hate illumination, attachment or delusion nor Longs For them when they disappear, who Is seated like one unconcerned being situated beyond these Material Reactions of The Modes Of nature. So sometimes we will understand Krishna consciousness. Illumination is there. We follow nicely. Sometimes we will not be able to understand Krishna consciousness. Still we follow nicely understanding what is the use of depending on this brain? Just depending on this brain. We have created so many institutions which are simply increasing the problems of life. So this brain is misleading. So many animals. They die. We have discussed ample number of times just following the dictates of the brain. So one should be very, very cautious not to depend upon one's own brain, but on the brain of God. So thus, illumination is present or is not present. It does not matter. I'm feeling strong attachment for sense objects. Illumination has gone away. But still I will not act because I have to follow the dictates of Krishna. That is called transcendental. So I am having attachment, I am having illumination or I am having delusion. But I have decided I will not follow the dictates of this body. Body will dictate as per the influence of the modes. But I should not follow the dictates of the body. So when these symptoms are present, a transcendental personality does not hate and when these symptoms are absent, one does not long for it. He is totally undisturbed by these symptoms. Let me understand Krishna consciousness, or let me not understand Krishna consciousness just like a small child does. Two ones are two. Twos are four two threes are six. He simply learns these tables by heart. He does not know. What is the use of such learning? Why am I coming to school? But he has faith on the parents. Parents would do something good for me. I am supposed to do it, he does it. And later he realizes that was the good thing. So that is why intelligences we should simply find an authority. We have some physical disease. We find a doctor and we surrender. Doctor, you open my stomach. You want to kill me? You kill, we sign an agreement, or if you please try, you can save me. That is good. So, similarly, we have to find a person, good, knowledgeable person who can solve all the problems of life for good and such a person is spiritual Master and like we surrender to surgeon, we have to surrender completely to spiritual master. So find nicely using our intelligence and then surrender then we are able to understand illumination is there or illumination? Is not there. Doubts may be there. Doubts may not be there at times. But a person does not budge in following the instructions of the authority doctor gives medicine. I follow. Doctor tells eat this I eat. Doctor tell. Does not eat. I do not. I may understand, may not understand. This is the meaning of not getting influenced by illumination, attachment and delusion who is seated like one unconcerned being, situated beyond these material reactions of the modes. Of nature, who remains firm, knowing that the modes alone are active, who regards alike pleasure and pain. So this is the dealing. Now, first Arjuna asks, what are the symptoms? And then, what is his behavior? How does he behave? So the behavior is he regards like pleasure and pain looks on a clawed a stone and a piece of gold with an equal eye how somebody can regard alike pleasure and pain. And if he regards alike, then why these two words are existing pleasure and pain? This is difficult to understand. First of all, you are defining there is pleasure and there is pain. And then you are telling alike also. So what is the meaning of this? The meaning is for body few things would be pleasant and few things would be unpleasant. So this body needs gratification satisfaction. So nobody likes to remain hungry but devotee enjoys hunger also he takes hunger for the pleasure of Krishna because he knows Krishna is getting pleased if I remain hungry on this day, do this tapasya so voluntarily he accepts tapasya so. This is called burden of love or labor of love. So very nicely. Three examples are given by Sri La Vishna Chakravarti Thakur just like wife is there wife is having the burden of husband while enjoying physical pleasures such a burden is not considered burden. Mother is having burden of child. When mother has taken child on the lab that is a burden but that is not considered burden. Or a businessman he is taking the burden of wealth on himself it is definitely great burden to earn money have so much of stress and anxiety but these things are not considered burden. Rather when these burdens are not present then the person would feel separation from these things. Wife would feel separation from the husband and businessmen would feel separation from the money. Mother would feel separation from the child. And the pain of separation is very very much more intense than this burden that they feel. Rather these burdens give pleasure in all these three cases. So in a similar fashion there would be few things which would be burdensome for the body. As we have told the basic tapasya that we do. And initially when we practice spiritual life so many disturbances are there for the senses. But devotee tolerates for the pleasure of Krishna. And taking such discomfort give a person spiritual happiness. Just like wife is having happiness by taking burden. Businessman is having happiness by taking burden of money. And mother is getting higher happiness of the heart by taking burden of taking a child on lab. Similarly taking pain for Krishna is a source of great spiritual ecstasy. At the same time it does not mean a person hates pleasure. There would be pleasure also. Once we fast, then we feast also we offer nice desist to Krishna. When Krishna appears then we enjoy feasting after fasting. And in that also devotee takes pleasure. Krishna is so merciful. He has given his remnants of foodstuffs to me. So thus there would be few things which would be pleasing. Few things would not be just. See what is the consciousness of a devotee. He is enjoying the pleasure and he's enjoying the pain also. Devotees, life is just full of enjoyment. So externally somebody may tell. So one of my relatives, he came to see me sometime back. And he has met me hardly a couple of times in last decade or so after I joined full time. So then he was sarcastically asking oh. You also got COVID. Oh, you are devotee of Krishna, why you are getting COVID? So it's difficult for them to understand. They think this external difficulty means devotee is in difficult. Of course I'm not telling that I can enjoy such things. But yeah, this consciousness devotee can cultivate even if there is suffering. Tattiyanukampam su samikshamano there is so much trouble. But devotee will always get pleasure. Always remember these three examples. It is not that pain I have to somehow tolerate. If we increase our pleasure for Krishna the pain would give us ecstasy. Not just little happiness or bliss ecstasy. Extreme happiness will come out of pain for Krishna. And when there is pleasure, there is again ecstasy. So thus devotees, life is Vishwam poonam sukhayate. He is always happy, always very jolly. So thus a devotee regards alike pleasure and pain. Looks on a clawed stone and a piece of gold with an equal eye. So devotee does not want a clawed a piece of stone or a gold for his own enjoyment. Basic phone or a smartphone for his own enjoyment. A devotee can leave very advanced phone if that phone is making him addicted for material pleasures. He will try to stick to a simple phone or give a phone. And if it is required for Krishna's service then he's willing to take up the most advanced technology also externally. Somebody can tell that oh this devotees just see he's using iPhone. What is the need of carrying a luxurious phone? No, it is required. You also have to preach. You have to shot good quality videos and other sound quality should be good. And all the gadgets should be of very high quality to give right preaching to people. So it is not because of personal enjoying tendency but it is for the service of Krishna. And if you see these things are detrimental for our life we get addicted to something. Devotee will give up all these things. So devotee does not want gold, diamond, stone or a cloth for himself. But he will accept everything for the pleasure of Krishna. So all these things are of equal value for him. If anything is of value in the service of Krishna stone can be used to make a deity for Krishna. Stone can be used to keep the demons away from harming Krishna. Then the devotees can use stones very nicely. Or gold is required to decorate Krishna to make temple for Krishna. Then gold also can be used very nicely. But for devotee there is no difference between gold piece of stone for his personal life who is wise and holds praise and blame to be the same. Similarly when a devotee wants to serve Krishna there could be so many blames. We have seen in Maharashtra so many nice devotees have been there. So many Varkaris, Tukaramji, other great devotees and so much persecution was given to them. Mirabhai was there, Haridas Thakur was there, Jesus Christ was there. So much persecution, so much dishonor and some people are praised also. And these devotees later got glorification or some other devotees got glorification. So in the service of Krishna there would be glorification, there would be praise. People may worship you and people may kill you also. But a devotee holds praise and blame to be the same. So these are big deceptions on material platform. So just this hankering for praise in the society is putting us through so much of hard work life after life. So wise person, he takes praise and blame to be the same. He just wants to stick to Krishna consciousness service of Krishna. And in this way everything is okay for him who is unchanged in honor and dishonor. Who treats friend and foe alike. So anybody who's helping him to advance in Krishna consciousness devotee takes him to be a friend. Just like Bali Maharaj Krishna took his entire wealth away ordinarily a person and even so called pious people. One person asked me, very religious person. So I was supposed to find a new place to start a new center in some city. So he. Helped a lot. He took us to various places, helped us to meet various influential people. And he was always with us, working very hard. But then he asked a question I'm not able to digest prabhu why Krishna cheated Bali Maharaj. He should not have cheated. No. So people think Krishna cheated. And Krishna is not a good person. Even so called pious persons. But Bali Maharaj, what is his consciousness? He told Krishna, thank you so much. I was attached to such temporary assets and you have taken it all away. You have made me realize the ephemeral nature of this material world. You are my greatest well wisher. Actually, similarly, parishit Maharaj, when he got cursed, he has to die in seven days from the womb of his mother. We practice bhakti when we actually come out. But from the womb of the mother. Parishit Maharaj was a pure devotee. He saw Krishna within the womb of Uttara. And since then he has always been meditating upon Krishna. Pure devotee of Krishna. He has never desired anything other than Krishna's service. But he got cursed to die in seven days. He did not rebel. He told it is very nice. It is favor of Krishna. He could have countercursed that boy. We become very angry with the people who curse us, create problems for us. But Parikshit Maharaj, although having ability, he did not counter curse. He took it as Krishna's plan. If anything happens by will of providence devotees take it as Krishna's will. He did not desire to die. But such curse has happened. It's okay. I live or die. What is there? So I have to serve Krishna in this body or in next body what Krishna gives us. So he understood Krishna's plan that I have to renounce. Maybe I was getting attached to my family, my opulence. So Krishna has rightly called me. Or I would have become attached. So thus he has complete faith in Krishna. Just like a sane child, intelligent child will have faith upon the parents. So although externally I am seeing, I'm having some difficulty. Krishna has taken these things away. These things could have made me more entangled in this world. So a devotee treats friend and foe alike. Sometimes enemies help us to advance in Krishna consciousness. Sometimes friend will help us advance. And if a friend is there who is taking us for material enjoyment then a friend would also be treated as enemy. Keep away from the enemy. So friends and foes are like anybody who is helping me to advance in Krishna consciousness, that is my friend. And anybody who's taking me away from Krishna consciousness, that is my enemy. But a devotee does not even hate his enemy indifference. He has for enemies. So friends and foes are alike who has abandoned all fruitive undertakings. He does not want to get the result of his activity for his own enjoyment. Because he knows everything belongs to Krishna. Such a man is said to have transcended the modes of nature. So as we can understand this is only possible. So this consciousness appears completely impractical, completely concept which should be kept in the book. But never it is possible to apply these things in our life, even a fraction of it. But as we discussed by vivid practical examples how this is very much possible for a devotee to attain this consciousness. But this is possible only in one way. So as we have discussed here. And thus you'll find in the Purport that Prabhupada is explaining how only through devotional service you can attain these things. So sometimes in translation also you'll find such extension of the meaning which is directly evident or which is directly represented by the words. And we may think Prabhupada is twisting the meanings and in Bhagavatam it is written. I also felt that Prabhupada is twisting where it is written bhakti it is told simply control the senses. Why Prabhupada is telling one who controls the senses for Krishna, for Krishna simply Prabhupada is adding. So then I read this loca in Bhagavatam or Chaitanya Charitamrita. So there it is mentioned that a person who is not in knowledge, he will think that the Acharyas are twisting the meanings of the Shlokas. But they are not twisting because they know the complete knowledge. They know how the state is possible. Thus for clear understanding they give added explanation. Just like a crude example, somebody goes to a local restaurant, he tells you please bring Tanda. Now what is Tanda thandam is cold, I should bring ice or water or what? Tandam is Coca Cola as they tell or whatever. So a person who knows the mind of the customer, he will bring what he requires. He may tell in any language. So a person knows the mind of God, he can tell what is the intention behind God speaking these limited words. Thus Brahma understood Bhagwatam just in four verses. But other living entities they understand Bhagavatam in 18,000 verses. And we need explanation of even those 18,000 verses. So intelligent beings who know the mind of God four verses are sufficient to understand entire Bhagavatam. So because Prabhupada and other pure devotees do no mind of Krishna, they give extended understanding. So bring thanda they would translate bring him Coca Cola. So because they know the mind of God. So thus why Prabhupada has explained so much of devotional service here Krishna has never mentioned devotional service. 1 may ask without being devotee one can attain this consciousness. You are telling one way, there could be other ways. So actually there are no other way. Thus Lord Krishna tells sometimes Lord Krishna has told in second chapter Watch principles krishna is telling to follow the reason. Lord Krishna will explain much much later. You should not get attached to the results of activity. Why Lord Krishna will explain much later? Because it has to be offered to me immediately. Krishna does not explain because a devotee may not be able to digest why Krishna is asking everything. Krishna explains his position and then he explains offer it to me. So in a similar fashion, Lord Krishna, fortunately here in the very next Loca explains how this consciousness is possible because Arjuna asked what are the symptoms, what is his behavior? And how does a person actually transcend the mode? So Lord Krishna in very clear words has explained so please read this very very important shloka how we also can attain this consciousness? And the answer is mamcha yogya bicharena bhakti yogena sevate Sagunan samtityaitan brahma Bhuya kalpate one who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of brahm mam chayo AV vyabicharyana. Vyabichari means person who is not chaste in his relationship. Avyabichari means very chaste and without fail he sticks to the determination. So AV vyabicharyana bhakti unfailing bhakti. Vanu follows sevate Sagunan sam. So just see. So we have some understanding of spiritual life. Spiritual life means spiritualist or saint should not be disturbed at all always equip poison. He should seek gold, cloth, piece of stone as equal praise and blame alike friend and enemy alike always well wishing, loving everybody. And we think there are many ways by which a person can attain this consciousness. But here Krishna tells no sir, there are no many ways. This is the only way. Mam chayo vya vicharayana bhakti yogena sevati very clearly Krishna has mentioned Bhakti yogaina. So in every other verse Lord Krishna is mentioning, as we keep on pointing out, Krishna explained three modes of nature and then Krishna tells only a person who is devotee, he can understand this thing. Now here Krishna explains consciousness of transcendent list only who is Avyabicharyana Bhakti Yogi and a sevate. Not that sometimes I do some other process, I go to some other God. No abhyabicharyana with complete chastity. Vanu does Bhakti only for Krishna Mam Mam Bhakti not any other Bhakti, bhakti of any person, bhakti of country, bhakti of humanity, bhakti of animals or bhakti of everybody. So Bhakti of Krishna includes service to everybody. But service of everybody does not include service of Krishna. If you put a water to the leaf, it is of no benefit to the leaf or for the tree. But if you pour water on the roots of the tree, it's service of tree as well as all the leaves, all the fruits and branches. So when a person engages in Bhakti yoga all the other duties are also completely fulfilled and a person is able to satisfy himself and God also. So just see, it is so clear. So those people who are recommending other processes, it means they are in great ignorance. They don't read Bhagavad gita even one chapter of Bhagavad gita they have not read thoroughly because in every chapter Krishna has told bhakti bhakti Bhaktiyama vijanati yavanyash Chasmi tatvatah only Bhakta Abhijanati can understand Me Tatvata scientifically. Krishna has told here again. Bhakti yoga. Krishna has told Arjuna Anasuya because you are non envious of me Bhakto asimi Sakha Chaiti, you are my Bhakta Surahasyam. I am explaining this knowledge to you. At the end of twelve chapter Bhakto Tiva Meh Priyaha such a Bhakta devotee is dear to me. So everywhere in every chapter within one chapter many times Krishna is explaining Bhakti Bhakti, Bhakti in nine chapter Krishna has told again most confidential knowledge. Manmana Bhamad Bhakto madhyaji Mamnamaskaru this is the verse which Krishna has repeated twice. And then at the end of Bhagavad Gita Krishna again repeats Shunume Paramam VA Chah again here the most confidential knowledge mana Bhavad Bhakto become my devotee. Krishna is not telling become Gyani, become Yogi. Krishna is rejected Gyani Yogi other people cannot understand. These are simply rungs of yoga ladder. So these things are not deprecated. Fifth standard is required. 8th standard, ten standard is required. But if a person remains stuck on any of these standards that is failure of education. He will not be able to attain the end of education. So if a person gets stuck oh I am Gyan Yogi. I am at topmost level. I am Karma Yogi. I am satisfied then there is no success for them unless a person comes to very clearly krishna has told Bhakti Yoga in a sevate this is the only process there is a culmination. By doing Karma yoga when a person starts giving up the results of activity some sense comes to him. And when he is able to develop sense he is able to follow Gyan Yoga. Cultivate knowledge. If a person is very greedy about accumulating more and more wants to enjoy everything for his own no sense can develop. So then Gyan yoga when he follows Gyan Yoga nicely senses are under control then he can meditate. If senses are not under control, meditation is not possible. So that is called dhyani yogi. And when he starts meditating he understands krishna reveals himself. He develops strong attraction for Krishna and he becomes a Bhakti Yogi. Then he starts engaging in service of Krishna. Now Kalyuga time being very very short and Lord Krishna understanding our fallen situation he has directly given this process of Bhakti by giving us association of pure devotees. So Bhakti Yoga needs so much of tapasya for many many lives. But all these tapasya, the credits of tapasya can be accumulated by doing some small service to a pure devotee of Krishna. That is how Srila Prabhupada simply by his association or Bhaktistan Maharaj or Acharyas were able to make thousands of people follow Bhakti Yoga which is very very rare thing in the universe. But such credits they are able to create by their association. So does this bhagavad gita. This is the ABCD of spiritual science. And everything is so clear here. And if you analyze people of other schools those who follow some other process. You understand. They are not very intelligent. Simply they are disturbed in sense enjoyment. They want some meditation which can give them some relief and some death has happened. Some anxiety is there and this problem is there. Body is weak so my body should become strong for sense enjoyment. Mind should become peaceful. So that I again jump into sense enjoyment. This is the purpose of their spiritual life. They don't question what is cause of all causes. No inquiry. What is the purpose of creation? What is the ultimate cause of all suffering? What is ultimate? When a person is being beaten by the police he tries to understand ultimate cause. Why police is beating me? Oh. Because he has given sentence. Why judge has given sentence? Because of advocate's argument. Why advocate argued against me or because I did this thing? So he tries to understand the ultimate cause of his suffering. So any person eita vadevi jiggyasyam any same person should have jiggyasa. What is the cause of this world, what is the cause of happiness, what is the cause of suffering? And any person who does not have ultimate query then they would be cheated. Some temporary process they will get and remain dissatisfied by following that process also. So this is the process actually maam chayo Abhiya vicharina Bhakti yoga with complete chastity without any deviation, complete surrender and Bhakti for Krishna Sagudan samtiti kalpate he at once. But abhiyabhi charana. That is why Prabhupada would tell all the Acharyas recommend that if you are not able to follow complete rules and regulations decide for yourself. I will chant. Prabhu only these many rounds that you chant without fail you protect that vow with your life. Do not eat that day if you have not finished your rounds do not sleep. Prabhupada so you became very busy. You are not able to finish their rounds. Second day without any fail you should. And of course that day itself we should not miss. But somehow it has happened for some reason the devotees don't miss usually ever. But somehow for some reason you missed so second day also. If you have missed then Prabhupada told it is cheating. Did you eat on the second day? Did you sleep on the second day? We will not die if you don't sleep on the second day. We will not die if you don't eat anything eating consumes half an hour, 1 hour or 2 hours in the entire day 2 hours you can finish your 16 rounds completely. So don't eat. Don't sleep the other day. But if you are eating also and sleeping also that means you are cheating. Krishna, we are not serious about our vows. So if we are not able to follow our vow we give arguments. All our insincere arguments. If we have eaten and if we have slept if second days next 24 hours I have not slept for a moment. I have not eaten anything in the entire day. Then that could be a genuine argument that I was so busy I could not eat and sleep. But if I have eaten anything, I've taken out time for those things. I have not followed my vows of spiritual master. Then that is cheating. So with such strictness that is called tapasya, this is called sadhana. This is the prime requirement for spiritual advancement. So decide as per your level but do not break that. Try to follow this with great determination that brings spiritual advancement. Then when that thing we are following Krishna will make the situation favorable. So that we are having chance to follow it in greater magnitude. Then one day, 24 hours we'll be serving Krishna very nicely. So Aviabi Chayana Bhakti without any fail we should follow very very strictly Prabhupada's military discipline. We know what is military discipline. They are so very much strict. Minute to minute discipline is there. That kind of discipline is required in spiritual life. Mam chayo vyabhi charana bhakti abhiyabhi charana Bhakti and then such a person who without any fall down follows Bhakti yoga very nicely, very very strictly saguna Sam he transcends these modes of nature attains such consciousness. And thus Lord Krishna explains brahmanohi pratistam. So Lord Krishna is telling Brahma bhuyaya kalpati he comes to Brahma platform. What is brahm? Now we are jeevha. I am thinking I am this body. So simply by speculating how and spirit soul we will not understand. We have to practically engage in service of Krishna and we will come just like in dream, a person can never understand I don't belong to this dream. He has to wake up in a similar fashion we have to do some activity which wakes us up. So when we follow Bhakti yoga we wake up, we understand I'm not the body, I'm spirit soul. That situation is called brahma bhuta. Brahma bhuaya kalpate. We are on the level of God. God is in full knowledge of his identity. We also become qualitatively one with God, not quantity. God is infinite. We remain always park infinitesimal. But quality is same. God is gold mine. We are particle of gold. And Lord Krishna tells we come to the level of Brahm, the spiritual effulgence which is coming from the body of Krishna. All the living entities who are situated there, they are on this platform. They completely understand I am not the body, I don't belong to matter. I am spirit, soul. And that brahmajyoti. Lord Krishna tells here brahmanohi pratishtaham Amritasya Viyayasyacha shashvatasya chadharmasya sukasya Kantikasyacha. And I am the basis of impersonal Brahm which is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness which is immortal, imperishable and eternal. And this brahm is called by the name Allah in Quran. Allah Akbar. God is great. So this great concept of God who is spread everywhere without form, that is called Brahma. So Krishna is continuously emanating energies from his bodies. And everything that we see is transformation of that energy. And that is called brahma. But from where this energy is coming. Because we see energies are taking very nice systematic shapes, systematic design. So there should be one conscious entity who is controlling these energies. So Krishna is telling yes, I am that conscious entity Brahmanohi. Pratishta. Pratishta means situation. I am the basis. I am the basis of impersonal Brahma Jyoti which is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness. So if we remain on this bodily platform we will always remain disturbed and we will suffer. But if we come to Brahma level then there is ultimate happiness and there is immortality on that platform. Eternity and imperishability. So human life is meant to at least come to that Brahma platform. And if we are fortunate so vanashrama system Sanyas brings us to Brahma level. And then if a person is fortunate, he can meet pure devotees like Kumaras or Shukdea Goswami. They were situated on Brahma. They are completely liberated personalities. Kumaras, they have controlled the growth of their body. And they know when the body grows then the body will have such lusty desires and we may get deviated from spiritual path. So they have controlled the growth of their body. Shukhdea goswami. He also knows So they also know. If I come out, modes of nature will act upon me. So let me not come out. He's staying in the womb of mother only. So all these were Brahma situated personalities. But when they met with pure devotees they also came to Bhakti Yoga pure devotional platform. So that's very important knowledge and human life is meant to realize this and how to attain this. Prabhupada explains. You can read this purport. Very simple process we have to follow. What is that? By engagement in devotional service in full Krishna consciousness he is immediately situated in transcendental position. And his unlawful desire to control material nature is removed. Therefore, the process of devotional service beginning with hearing, chanting, remembering the prescribed nine methods for realizing devotional service should be practiced in association of devotees. So association of devotees is very much required. Okay, prabhu, I have realized bhakti yoga. I'll follow. So the prime requirement for following Bhakti Yoga is association of devotees. Chanting, hearing, remembering, worshipping all the other processes without association. If we are not in association of devotees, we are in association of materialists. We'll get influenced by their material energies. So thus all this Bhakti Yoga should be followed in association of devotees. And gradually by such association by the influence of the spiritual master. So what happens in that association? We get influenced by spiritual master. So the devotees are acting under the influence of spiritual master. And if we associate with them, we also come under such influence of spiritual master. And only when we are under the influence of spiritual master, spiritual energy flows in us. So when spiritual energy flows in us, one's material desire to dominate is removed. So dominating tendency is the root cause of all problems. Krishna is predominator. We are predominated. This method is prescribed from the 22nd to last verse of this chapter. So Prabhupada tells this devotional service to the Lord is very simple. One should always engage in service of the Lord, should eat the remnants of foodstuffs, offer to the deity, smell the flowers, offer to the lotus feet of the Lord. See the places where the Lord has his transcendental pastimes. So that is why we conduct pilgrimages trips every year. So thus we recommend at least every four months you must visit. You must go for a trip every three to four months. One trip. One should go to keep Himself spiritually surcharged. So all these things are very much prescribed by the Shastras. See the places where the Lord had his transcendental pastimes. Thus people would go for tirthyatra, especially at the old age. Because death can happen anytime now. And if I am having disease, I am having the bad karmas from this life. Then next life terrorists will bomb me or Corona will kill me. Or my family members will give me so much of trouble and unlimited troubles I will have. So people would go for tirtsthal. So in all the places of pilgrimage God is personally present. He may be visible or he may be invisible. Krishna is always in Vrindavan chaitanya. Mahaprabhu is always present in Mayapur. Jagannath puri. But they are visible at some times. Once in a day of Brahma, other times they are invisible. But God is always present. So by taking direct association of God in the place of pilgrimage we get freed from all the sins. And thus people who don't chant anything, they suddenly come to eight rounds. 16 rounds become very strong in Bhakti. So visiting the places where Lord had his transcendental pastimes is also very important factor. And these are simple things. Read of the different activities of the Lord, his reciprocation of love with his devotees and chant always a transcendental vibration. Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Ram hare Ram Ram Ram Hari Hare. And observe the fasting days commemorating the appearance and disappearance of Lord and his devotees. By following such process one becomes completely detached from all material activities. One who can thus situate Himself in the Brahmajyoti is equal to the supreme personality of Godhead in quality. So the process is very simple. But this process is not revealed unless a person has done this rigorous tapasya, karma Yoga, Gyan Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga he has fasted for many years and so much tapasya. Then this thing is revealed. But we are fortunate. By association of Srila Prabhupada we are able to understand these things very very simply. So let us try to follow this simple process in the association of devotees. And we will also attain this consciousness which is impossible for any materialist to imagine. So now we will conclude today's session and we'll be following the most important process to come to this Brahma platform. All other eight methods of devotional service depend upon this prime method. And that is hearing, chanting and hearing the names of God. So those who are new, this process is very simple. Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna. Krishna Krishna hari Hare. Hare ram. Hare ram. Ram. Ram. Hari hare. So we'll be chanting 21 times. After that, we'll take questions and answers. Be very attentive. God is incarnated in the form of his name. This should be our understanding. So hear each and every word very nicely. And before this special mantra, please chant after me.
