Sri bhagavanuvacha parambuya pravakshami gana namgyanamutam Yajgyatma munayasarave param saddim Itogata translation the blessed Lord said again I shall declare to you the supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge knowing which all the sages have attained to supreme perfection. So Lord Krishna is telling here param gyanam gyana nam gyanam uttamam I am going to declare you the topmost of all knowledge. And the word which is used here is Bhuyaha. Bhuyaha means again so Lord Krishna has been repeating this the topmost knowledge, confidential knowledge. But because it is important, it is being repeated. So sometimes we may find some words are being repeated again. Some phrases are being recoted over and over again. So Prabhupada explains because this thing is very important. That is why it is being quoted over and over again. But this time in this chapter, Lord Krishna explains in a different way. Lord Krishna explained that the living entity gets entangled by the three modes of nature. And he's working helplessly under the three modes of nature. Actually, the prakriti is doer. We are not the doer. This is what we understood in the previous chapter. Nature forces living entity to act helplessly as per the modes of nature we have acquired. As we all understand, our tendencies are because of the bodies which we have acquired, our food, what we like or what we dislike. People whom we like or we dislike. Our actions, our walking, our talking everything depends upon three modes of nature. Now what are these three modes of nature which are helplessly pushing and pulling the living entities in this material world? We understood if you have seen the laws of nature, the COVID page very nicely. It is being mentioned. There are three women who are controlling two men who are fighting with each other. They are controlling the men through springs. So these are the three energies of Krishna, the three modes of nature. Just like the puppets dance very nicely on the stage but there is a puppeteer who is pulling the strings. The puppets are helpless. They may be doing some wonderful activities in a similar fashion. We may show very great intelligence at times. But actually that intelligence is also the result of mode of nature. A person can appear to be very very dumb. Their dumbness is also because of mode of nature. So in this way, what are these energies which helplessly drive the living entities? That Lord Krishna will be explaining how these living entities capture the living how these three energies capture the living entity and how the living entity can get liberated again using these modes of nature. So all these things very nicely scientifically lord Krishna will explain in this chapter. And Lord Krishna tells here yajgyatva Munaya survey. Munaya means the sage is Muni. So unless somebody is Muni, muni means person who is very thoughtful. It is not possible to understand krishna kunti Marani says SATA paramahansanam Muninam amalatmanam Bhakti Yoga, Vidhan Artham Katham Pashe mahistriah, you are known by Paramhansas. What is Paramhansa? The top most living entities, laws of nature, they don't apply upon them. The three modes of nature do not act upon them. They are free to do whatever they want. No laws, no rules and regulations apply on them. Paramhansanam, Muninam. So such thoughtful Paramhansas, amalatmanam who are very very pure in their heart. Bhakti yoga vidhan artham So they can understand you by the process of Bhakti yoga. Katham pashima historya. But I am ASTRI I am a woman. So by nature I am very much attached to Pandavas and Vishnis to my son. So woman has two kinds of attachments. Husband's side and father's side. So normally we want to increase our attachment. But Kuntimarani prays to Krishna Dhrim pandushu Vishnishu. So this affection which I have towards my sons Pandavas and Vishnis, my father's family, please cut down this knot of attachment. Because of this attachment I am not able to understand you. So because women are naturally very much attached it is very very difficult to understand Krishna. So this is a virtual platform which is created by Krishna and all the species. What we see around us. There are different machines which a living entity acquires to satisfy the desires. So every living entity has got unique desire. But all these desires can be summed up in 84 lakh species. So whatever unique combination permutation of desires a living entity can harbor. Lord Krishna knows being the supreme personality himself. So he has created all these. Whatever desires you can have, whatever kind of enjoyment you can even think of all those things are available in all these 8.4 million species. So as per the unique desire which a living entity develops, he transmigrates through those species of life. So as long as the living entity is very much attached it is not possible to understand Krishna. So Kuntivarani is telling how will I understand you, Krishna? I am a woman. I am very much attached. But only the Munis who are Paramhansas who are very very pure in heart who are free from all the lust and greed they are able to understand you. So that is why the Vedic culture is designed in such a way as we discussed. It is not to put down some set of people that these are shudras, these are vaishyas. They should be given less respect in the society. Yes, of course. Respect is relative. Everybody is respected in the society. But not equal respect. Relative respect. Anybody who's studying in school and college and doing the tasks of their own class very nicely they will be very much encouraged. They will not be discouraged. Why you are there in fourth standard. That is a capacity of living entity. If you perform nicely in fourth standard, they are promoted fifth standard to 6th standard. 7th standard. In this way promotion happens. So the society is divided very nicely. Not to oppress the lower classes but to facilitate their promotion and by promoting gradually through various segments of Varnashrama system. Ultimately living entity is supposed to become Amuni and Yajgyatva Munaya Sarvedan amuni thoughtful person bhakti Yoga Vidhanartam by practicing Bhakti Yoga he can understand Krishna. So Krishna tells now I'm again explaining you this knowledge understanding which the munis they have attained param Siddhi Mithogataha supreme perfection. In the previous chapter Lord Krishna told do not worry about Siddhi, siddhiya Siddhya Samu Bhuttwa Samatvam Yoga Chate in this world we are very much eager that I should attain perfection in my tasks. I should become successful. So Krishna told don't worry about material perfection or imperfection material success or failure. Do your duty very nicely and offer the results to me without worrying about whether it would be successful or not. Put your level best and that is called Yoga. But here Krishna is telling if you follow this gyan you will attain Siddhi. So there Krishna is telling Siddhya Samo Bhuttva so Siddhi or asidhi you remain equipoise but here Krishna is telling you will attain Siddhi. So why Krishna is discouraging Siddhi in one place and encouraging Siddhi in another place? Because this Siddhi is not ordinary Siddhi. Whatever Siddhis we may have if a person is 100% Tyler in some exam that is also a Siddhi perfection of that examination. If a person has performed very nicely in his department there is another Siddhi. But on material platform there are eight very very exalted Siddhis and very advanced materialists. They hanker for those Siddhis which are those Siddhis. And they are the object of all the rigorous endeavors of Yogis. And these Siddhis are anima lagima Darima mahima ishita Vashita Prakamya prapti. So these are the Siddhis which perfection which a human body can give. These are far far beyond even the conception of modern scientists or philosophers or any materially successful man. So if a person actually takes help of the vedas then he can do such wonderful feats. Become anima smaller than the smallest. Like an ant or even small, almost invisible. Nobody will be able to capture that person. He'll become smaller than the smallest anima Siddhi. And this Siddhi was displayed by a speaker of Shrimad Bhagwatam shukde goswami. Shukde Goswami was liberated from the birth. He was having all the Siddhis. So thus for 16 years he remained in the womb of the mother. So as soon as the living entity comes out if the living entity spires 7th month onwards they get consciousness and then they start suffering. The living entity spires he prays that please Krishna, take me out. I will engage in your devotional service. But when he comes out then he forgets. And then he gets lost in the affection shown by the relatives. And this is how Maya works. Then the living entity gets entangled and then thinks oh I am very nicely protected cared by my loving relatives. And then he gets entangled. So material world is like that. It is nectar in the beginning but the end result is poisoned. There is so much of suffering in the end. So Shukda Goswami being a liberated personality advanced in knowledge. He was not willing to come out. So 16 years. Just imagine, not long ago, just 5000 years ago. So Shukda Goswami, son of Vedvyas was not coming out. Even though his father is Vedas he did not want to take any chance. He told I will not come out. Outside is Maya, I will get entangled again. So then Krishna had to come. And Krishna told do not worry, you will not be entangled. And then Shukhdya Goswami came out. But he understood this affection of parents or this is very big Maya. So life after life because of this affection we get lost. So he told now in this life I don't want to get carried away by any such allurements given by the Maya. So Shukdya Goswami, as soon as he took birth without caring for anything he walked out of the house. And his father is chasing him. Son, please stay back. But he's not listening at all. As soon as he took birth again he expanded his form. He was a yogi. He grew up like a young boy. Although he has just come out of the womb. And he started walking out of his house. So this called anima Siddhi. The body for 16 years did not expand in the womb. And there is Mahima Siddhi. Mahima means you see various demons who are there coming and attacking Krishna. And they are so tall. 8 miles tall and even bigger than that. So how some living entity we think it is fiction. No, it is not fiction. Just like our body was p sized and now it has grown so much, so big. So there is a science by which the body grows. So if a person knows how the body is growing we can expand it further. When from p size or from 1ft it has grown to 6ft or 7ft it can become even taller and bigger. So one who knows how this matter grows then he can make it grow further. That is called Mahima Siddhi. So living entity can become very tall. And these were the acts of all the demons. How they were able to get such big bodies? That is called Mahima Siddhi. Huge. Then Lagima, you can become very very light. And thus many Yogis, they do levitation. They can fly just like that in the air. They become very light. And there is garima. Garimamis. They can become very very heavy. And they can prapti siddhi. They can attain anything. Whatever is available in the universe. They can create wonderful things. Like Kardamuni description is there. He created a flying city immediately. And that city was having palaces. That city was having so many servants. And all the facilities, fountains, everything was arranged. So this is possible immediately. So it is not that gradually you have to go through a gradual mechanical process. You put one brick, second brick, third brick, cement, like that. In that way you are manifesting. So we have to understand everything has been manifested already. Just like a computer game is there inside the computer game you may encounter some water, some roads, some houses. Those houses have already been created. So of course you might have to build slowly in the computer game as per the rules and regulations. But those houses have already been created by the creators. So in a similar fashion, we are not creating, destroying anything. The creation has already been done. We act as an instrument and that thing becomes manifest through us. So all the things are existing and those people who are advanced, they can immediately bring something into manifestation. So such yogis can immediately not just create flying cities like Muni created, they can create planets also. And there is description vishwamitra was so powerful that he created planets also. Planetary system he created just imagine. So this is the power of Yogi. So they can do such extraordinary feats with great ease and they can take any form which they desire. And that is how Ahilya was cursed. Because the devatas and other powerful living entities and yogis, they can take any form which they desire. So these are some of the wonderful Siddhis. And a yogi gets it automatically in the course of spiritual advancement. But if the yogi gets diverted by such powers such siddhis then he will not attain the Absolute truth. He will not attain understanding and love of God. So such siddhis usually are aspired for by the ashtanga yogis and some of the ashtanga yogis who are really advanced. They don't care about such siddhis and they neglect such siddhis. They are not carried away and they aspire to understand the supreme Personality who is seated within the heart. But all these siddhis are of no use because they are also very insignificant. They just offer some temporary results. Temporarily, you can become very big or very small, very light or very heavy. And you can try to get some large following by showing some small siddhis. But then what is the use? Because these Siddhis go away with the body. So that is why such siddhis material siddhis have been discouraged by Krishna. Because you are eternal why you are working very hard for some temporary achievement. If somebody tells us that you become the CEO of this company and after ten years of doing this job you have to work as a dog in my house I will tie a neck strap around you and I will tie you to my gate. You have to sit there. So that would not at all be acceptable by us but the same thing is happening with all of us the living entities so that is why anything temporary is of no value when in the next life you can start an animal species or in any other form of life. But you are supposed to attain Param Siddhim. Param Siddhi means the topmost success, the topmost perfection of life. And what is that topmost Siddhi that a person can attain by understanding knowledge mentioned in this chapter. 14 chapter what is that Siddhi which Lord Krishna tells we should actually aspire for? Idam Gyanam Upashritiya Mamasadharmya Magata, Sarge, Pinopa, jayante Pralay Navyatanticha idam Gyanam Upashritya if you know this knowledge by becoming fixed in this knowledge one can attain to the transcendental nature which is like my own nature. Thus established when it was not born at the time of creation nor disturbed at the time of dissolution. So Krishna is telling Mama sadharmyam. Agathah sadharmyam means nature. Dharma means one's intrinsic nature or quality. Just like Dharma of fire is to produce heat and light it is not possible to have fire which does not produce light or heat. That is called intrinsic nature. So if a person follows this path, he will get Siddhi. And then the perfection of knowledge perfection. The topmost Siddhi is that we get a body which is having nature of Krishna's body. What is the nature of Krishna's body? Krishna took birth 5000 years ago and then one hunter shot an arrow and Krishna was killed. This is the general perception which Krishna creates to bewilder the atheistic people. So that is why we should never judge Krishna by the activities. Kunti Marani tells NATO Natyadharoyata just like we see a performer on the stage doing a drama he can appear that oh, I am dying, I am having disease. And in this way you perform various activities on the stage. And just like the relatives are sometimes not able to identify their own family member who is dressed up in a different GetUp on the dramatic stage in a similar fashion we are not able to understand you. We mistake you to be an ordinary human being. So Krishna acts like an ordinary human being. He acts as if he's taking birth. He acts as if he's dying. But you have to understand from Krishna what is actually Krishna's nature. So Krishna tells if you follow this knowledge, you will attain body of My nature. And what is my nature? Sarge no pajayante pralayena vyatanticha so creation is called Sarga. And at the time of creation all the species, they get their bodies and birth happens of all the living entities. And then there is destruction also we get destroyed. That is called death. That is individual destruction. But there is destruction at mass level also. So an atom or the bodies that we acquire or the body of the universe, they all follow the same principle. So even the smallest bodies have creation and destruction. Our bodies have individual creation and destruction. And just like so many cells are there which constitute our human body the cells also have got their individual creation or destruction. And regularly it is happening. New cells are being produced and the cells are being destroyed. But there is a time when this body which is like universe to so many small cells. Within this body every cell is a living entity. Cell that has metabolism, cell as growth, cell as reproduction. Cell has got defense mechanism. So all the things that we have, the cell also has got the same thing. Birth, growth, maintenance byproducts and dwindling vanishing. So these six changes we also undergo through. Cell also undergoes through. So we are like universe and the cell is like a living entity. So so there's many living entities are having individual birth and death. But when there is time of death of this body then all the cells have to die automatically. In a similar fashion we have our individual death and birth. But when there is a time for universal destruction that is called pralaya, then all the living entities have to die. But Lord Krishna tells pralaye navya thanticha So you are not disturbed at a time of destruction of entire universe. Also if you attain body of my nature. What is Krishna's nature? Satchidananda vigraha krishna's nature is Sat. Sat means eternal. Chit means full of knowledge and Anand means full of bliss. So if you follow this knowledge we also attain a body. So the first part of creation is called Sarga. What is called sarga. There are different stages of creation. The prime stage of creation. So there is nothing in this world but Krishna and his energies. So one portion of the existence there is a specific energy of Krishna which is called material energy. And this material energy emanates from the body of Krishna. And it is spiritual energy only. But it acts in a different way. Just like the policemen, they are also belonging to the government. But they act in a different way. And they are meant for punishing the criminals. In a similar fashion the spiritual energy of Krishna acts in a different way to put the living entities in a troublesome state. Those living entities who are not willing to surrender to Krishna. So those living entities are given the shelter of the material energy and how this creation begins. So in a corner of the spiritual sky the entire existence there is cloud of material energy. And this material energy comes from the body of Mahavishnu. Expansion of Lord Krishna. And all these things are very nicely described in the Srimad Bhagavatam. And then Lord Vishnu glances in the Mahatatva. And by the glance of Lord Vishnu the living entities are impregnated into the Mahatatva. And then there are three modes of nature which are there in the dormant state. In the Mahatatva they are not manifest. What is the meaning of not manifest? Just like various features are there. There is a girl and there is mother. Mother and girl, there is no difference. But when the mother exhibits a living entity when a girl exhibits a living entity within the womb she is called mother. So in a similar fashion there is always tendency of this material energy to create so many living entities. The bodies of the living entities. But when these energies are dormant that is called pradhan. The name is given and the pradhan is called Mahatva. When it is agitated, as soon as the child is conceived in the womb of the girl by the husband then the girl immediately is called mother. In a similar fashion, the material energy which is called pradhan. As soon as it is agitated then it is called Mahatva. And then from the Mahatatva, the three modes of nature they start mixing. Just like the energies within the womb of the mother. They start acting and they start developing child within the womb. So all the energies are there but they are dormant. They are not active to create a child. Unless the soul takes shelter of the womb of the mother. In a similar fashion all the energies are dormant. The nature is not manifest. And all these varieties that we see around us so many species of life, mountains, valleys, hills, rivers nothing is manifest unless the living entities taken shelter of the material energy. So when the living entity takes shelter these energies are manifest and they start mixing. And when they start mixing, the creation happens. Similar thing what happens in the womb of the mother, that happens in the universe also. The same principles apply everywhere. Thus an atom is also called a sample universe. So when these three modes of nature start mixing with each other then from the Mahatatva one energy called false ego is created. Due to this energy the living entity starts identifying itself with the body. Living entity thinks I am the body. And these bodies we change life after life. And at night also we pick up different bodies in dreams. And we have a tendency of identifying with those bodies because of this energy called ahankar which is called false ego. Then there is energy of buddhi by which we are able to use our intelligence. There is energy which is called mind by which we control the senses. And then the sensual energies are manifest. Ten kinds of sensual energies. The energy to taste, energy to watch, energy to hear, energy to talk. And then the five working senses are created. The gross matter is created. Earth, air, water, fire, sky. So this creation is called Sarga. 24 elements are created. And then second stage of creation is called visarga. Visarga means now these ingredients have to be mixed. So just like the ingredients are basic few spices would be there and some vegetables would be there. But you can create unlimited varieties of dishes simply by mixing those things simply from milk. You can make so many kinds of sweet items. You can make nice condensed rice. You can make shrikhand, you can make kheer, you can make sandesh, you can make gulab jaman, you can make rasgula. And so many things can be made simply out of milk and sugar. So in a similar fashion, simply by these 24 ingredients, all these bodies that we see around us are manifest, and that is called visarga. This is done by Lord Brahma. So Lord Brahma is called the engineer. The prime ingredients are given by Krishna, and then Lord Brahma mixes it and produces all the varieties of bodies that we have around us. So thus it is very, very difficult to believe. But as we discussed, one has to be a muni to understand what is truth of life. Now nobody's thoughtful. So Vedic culture was designed in such a nice way that everybody has ample time to be thoughtful. So mainly people were taking to cultivation, if at all, they have to do a job and they may take out two crops at times, but they may take out one crop and work for just three months and nine months. They will be cultivating Krishna consciousness. So in this way, a person is even if he has to take two crops from the field, he has got six months. So people would have ample time to practice Krishna consciousness. They are very, very peaceful and they are thoughtful, but now there is no time. So now we read this theory, Origin of Species. We read theory, atomic theory. Have we ever pondered what is the basis on which these theories have been given to us? When we hear of such theories, then we may ask 100 questions how do we believe, how do we understand and all these things? But we don't ask that. How do we believe such theories? And when we more so are seeing that these theories are changing, because actually nobody is thoughtful, there is such intense competition that you have to simply mug up and you have to write. And by the time you realize that you have become expert in mugging up the subject matter, new books are given to you, you move to a different standard. Then you mug up books of different level. In this way, entire life gets wasted simply by cramming the syllabus. But there is no thoughtfulness, so we can understand. So, just like there are different car models, there is Maruti, which popularized the private cars in India. Otherwise there were just Ambassadors and Fiats. And then Maruti brought so many cars, there was 800, then there was then thousand, there was Esteem. So suppose an earthquake happens and there is an Maruti 800, which is there inside, there is Alto, there is Zen, there is Esteem, and all these are there buried within the earth. So should a person think, oh, actually this is called evolution of cars. There was Maruti 800 that automatically evolved into Alto, alto into Zen, zen into Esteem. And like that the cars evolved. No, it is not possible. These are different models which may be having gradual, what do we called, additional designs have been given to them and basis the affordability of the customer. A person cannot suddenly afford a big car. There is a car which is little bigger than that. So in a similar fashion, as per the affordability of karma of the living entity different machines have been created by nature. So is it very difficult to understand a camera? We can never think it will manifest by itself. So how do we think that eyes have got manifested by itself? Simply by combination of matter the eyes developed and we started seeing the world. Is it possible? Can you ever imagine after 10 million, 100 million or 1000 million or billions of years one day you will see one very nice Canon digital camera standing here. Is it possible? It is not possible. A camera cannot come. But we think dyes which are most sophisticated camera there is auto focus and automatic. The intensity of light is also controlled. There is cornea shutter and it is very very complex camera. And then there are so many other things. There is this brain which can create computer is such an advanced computer can you ever think computer will manifest by itself? And just see, this brain is there functioning at very low energy but very high power computer. So can we ever imagine that such a complex thing like this brain can assemble automatically the pump which is working entire life? It never stops. Do we have any machine which is pumping like that continuously without any stoppage? So how we can think that all these things have developed and these machines are so very complex? As we discussed in previous session even one drop of blood cannot be produced in the laboratory. The blood has got so much of mechanism and design within it we cannot produce blood. What to speak of this entire wonderful body that we have got? Everything is very nicely being put into place. And not just this body, there is proper design. There are genders which are created. Can we ever create a car which can produce further cars? Can we ever create a mobile? Male mobile, female mobile. You bring them close enough and third mobile would be born. And in this way mobile will produce mobile. Is it possible of the same make? Not possible. So just see how extraordinary it is. So in Bhagavatam it is being discussed. So a sane person should think how there is dependence among the living entities. There is dependence within the same gender. Man is dependent on woman, woman is dependent on man. So how is it possible that evolution can happen? Some group of atoms are thinking let us combine in a certain way because other group of atom are going to combine together in a male form. So we have to complement them. Suppose the female form is not developed at the same place, the male same pace male form cannot survive. If male form is not evolved at the same pace, female form cannot survive. Suppose female form remained monkey female. And this male has become a human, then it is not possible. So male form, female forms in all the species are there and both have to represent simultaneously together at all times for the species to continue. So a group of atoms decided that we have to combine in a certain way and then we have to produce nectar, because there is another group of chemicals which are combining together to become a bumblebee and it will come and take out the nectar. And one group of atoms is combining very nicely and producing the syringe from which that small insect, it can take out the nectar from the flowers. So there is dependence within the same species, there is dependence between the different species. A group of chemical thoughts. Let us now make a very nice mechanism of breathing oxygen, because there is another group of chemicals which are thinking of exhaling oxygen. So we will inhale oxygen in this way. Very nice symbiotic arrangement in nature will continue. So it is just foolishness. But because there is no time to be a money, a thoughtful man, we simply cram up, we write the syllabus and we move on. It is very complex. Each cell is more complex than the metropolitan city. Darwin was not knowing that time. That time our science was telling chemical, the cell is just a bundle of chemical. But now the science knows cell is more complex than the metropolitan city. So within cell lies a metropolitan city. And this cell can create another cell, a city can create another city. What is this extraordinary science? So thus it is not wise to tell that car got evolved into bigger car, bigger car got evolved into a helicopter, helicopter got evolved into a spaceship, no. So these are unique machines, unique bodies which have been created differently. And they exist parallel in this way, in parallel all the species, they have always existed. So thus, for details you can refer to Srimad Bhagavatam. So how all these species have created. So all these species are coming from mahavishnu creates first form, first living entity in this universe. And that is Lord Brahma. Lord Brahma comes out of the navel. From the navel lotus flower comes and on that Lord Brahma manifests. And similar principle applies here. Also from the womb of the mother there is connection. Through the navel only the child comes out. So that Lord Brahma, he creates all the other bodies. And these bodies, of course, are manifested through various species, living entities. And in Bhagavatam six, Kanto 6th chapter, you'll find the description. So there was Daksh Prajapati and Daksh Prajapati was producing many, many sons. And these are very powerful living entities. We can produce one son, or at times there are twin children, two sons or daughters can come out. But these living entities are so powerful, not one or two or dozen like some animals, but they can produce hundreds of children also. So Daksha was producing hundreds of children, thousands, 10,000. And Narad Muni, being a strong and powerful preacher, he was making all of them sanyasi. So Daksh became very much disturbed. So this time he created daughters. And he understood, because daughters cannot take sannyas. So this time I am safe. Let me produce living entities in the form of daughters. So he produced daughters, and the daughters were married to different sages. So mainly, all the species that we see, including the species of it could be bird, it could be snake, or all the other living entities, they are the progenys from the daughters of Daksha. So 1 may wonder, how is it possible that human being is producing bird? Human being is producing tiger, elephants and snakes. So no, it is possible even now we can see. So this is the nature of this body which Krishna has created. It can do such amazing wonders. Even we also produce many many species. Some of them which are very small with perspiration. So many bacterias, they come out of our body. And sometimes when we don't clean our hair so small crawling insects, they appear on the head and if we don't take bath for many many years different insects will appear on the skin also. So this body is capable of producing other species. If proper evacuation is not happening then tapeworms will develop within the stomach and so many other worms are anyway manifesting within the stomach which bite the child in the womb. Bhagavatam describes. So thus we are also capable of producing miniature snakes or some other or miniature animals in the form of small germs which we can produce in the air, in the hair. So human being is anyway producing different species. So there are other species which are much much more powerful than us human beings. And thus they can produce all the other species of life. So that is the nature of this body. We are capable of producing other species. So in this phase, so many species came into existence. Lord brahma has manifested everything. Just like the programmer of a computer game, he has created everything. All the characters, all the unique forms which you can take in the game, those are well defined. Among these eight forms, you can choose any one. In a similar fashion, among 8.4 million species, we can choose one basis. Our karma. That we can do. So all these species of life we can understand it is common sense it is not possible to evolve like that gradually and nothing happens. There is no proof of this thing and as per the laws of physics also law of thermodynamics the complexity of universe can never increase. Randomness in universe increases. Entropy of the universe increases. So if the entropy of the universe randomness is increasing that we can understand unless there is some conscious living entity things can only increase in randomness systems cannot come if teacher is not there in the class children cannot be disciplined. There would be randomness. If there are no managers in a company, the company cannot function nicely. If there is no traffic police, there are no signals, traffic cannot move nicely. So randomness increases always, unless there is a conscious living entity. So we say that from simple organisms, complex living entities have come about. This violates the third law of thermodynamics also. But anyway, there is no time to think about all these things courtesy the civilization which we have got now. But here Lord Krishna very clearly, he's mentioning this is also a science. Why we believe in science when we are not able to verify such theories? We simply hear and we believe without checking, because science has produced some results for us. Science has produced television, air condition, houses and computers and automobiles, spaceships, like that. But through Vedic technology also, you can have such things like Sanjay here, Sanjay is also able to have a natural television in the heart. And he's describing whatever is happening on the battlefield of Kurukshetra. And as we have discussed in perfect knowledge, how there are so many evidences and so many applications of the Vedic philosophy, especially the Vedic medicine, ayurveda, there is a cure for so many diseases, in which allopathy it is not there. And so many things which I explained to you how by that process our devotee got the kidney stone removed from without any surgery, simply by some mantra, some process. Immediately the stone came out. And I gave another example how the grandfather of one of the devotees, he's very expert in taking out the poison by giving some herbs and chanting some mantras. And you can see the poison coming out of the they make a cut, and from that cut, the poison is coming out along with the blood, and the living entity gets cured. But now, of course, the sciences are there, but practical application, if we have to do, then some experts are required. So gurukuls are not there. So now we don't see people applying these sciences in many places, but nevertheless still in many places, if you go and search, you'll find many such evidences. So thus people were seeing these things practically happening. So they were having very strong faith in the Vedas. But now, unfortunately, we do not have. So just like as per the modern astronomy, we have certain understanding of the world, of the universe. The sun is moving in a certain way. The moon is they don't tell sun moves actually. But as per the Vedic understanding, the sun is moving. But from the both understandings, we are able to very nicely calculate the calendar, calculate the eclipses, calculate sunrise, moonrise and all these things. So if we are able to calculate when there would be next sunrise, next moonrise, the time of sunrise, sunset, we are able to calculate. It means this model is also perfect what is given in the Vedas. Although Vedic model is completely different it tells a geocentric version of the universe that sun goes for Uttarayan, sun moves toward the north in a spiral, and then the sun comes down that is called dakshin iron. So thus, whatever our reasons for putting faith in the modern scientific theories, we can have same things for the Vedic scientific theory as well. But all those people who have dedicated their lives, who are very, very thoughtful, they want to understand what is truth of life, they have put their faith in the Vedic knowledge. And thus Lord Krishna, the authority, all those people who have dedicated their lives to understand truth, they put faith upon Lord Krishna, except him as Supreme Personality. Thus, Bhagavad Gita is read by anybody and everybody, despite so called some little differences in the philosophy. And thus Lord Krishna tells here what is the origin of all the species. Mam yonir Mahat brahma tasmin garbam dadham Miham sambhava sarva Bhutanam tato bhavati bharata the total material substance called brahm. Just like from one white light, we take out many colors and you mix those colors, and then we see so many other paintings and other things we can create, but basically it is white light only. In a similar fashion, from Mahat Brahma mahatva Satva Rajasthama's three energies are created and they mix together, and then all these forms we see around us. So the origin of species lies not within the material nature, but Lord Krishna tells here sambhava sarvabhutanam tasman Garbham dadhami aham the total material substance called Brahm is the source of birth. And it is that Brahm that I impregnate, making possible the births of all living beings. Osan of Bharat so Krishna is telling I impregnate, just like the father impregnates the mother. Through the semen of the father, the soul takes shelter of the womb of mother. In a similar fashion, tasman Garbham dadhami aham I impregnate that material energy, the body is definitely created by the mother. So all the bodies of the species are definitely created by the material nature. But material nature is not the origin of the species, as modern science tells. So here Lord Krishna tells mum yonir Mahat Brahma mahat Brahma gives the body, but I impregnate all the species. Example given is in villages you'll find many scorpions, and sometimes it is believed, scorpions, they emerge out of rice. But rice is not the origin of scorpion. The scorpion lays its eggs in piles of rice. So sometimes it is said that scorpion is born out of rice. That is not fact. In a similar fashion, the living entities are impregnated into material nature and the bodies develop. So sometimes it is mistaken if a person analyzes, he does an experiment very nicely. For 5678 months, he keeps the mother in close custody, and no person is allowed to come near. And then he will tell actually, nobody came near, mother independently produced the child. But that is foolishness. If you analyze for a very long time, in the beginning Father impregnated. So thus our research work is imperfect. So in a similar fashion we have to understand just like the Father impregnates Mother. Here Krishna is telling same principles which apply in this body, they apply in the universe also the Supreme Personality impregnates material nature. And Krishna tells here in the fourth verse sarva yonishu Kantaya Sarvi Yonishu means in all the species of life murtaya sambhavantiyaha TASAM brahmam hadyoner hambija pradha. It should be understood that all species of life O Son of Kunti are made possible by birth in this material nature. And that I am the seed giving father. So all the species of life are made possible by birth in this material nature. And that I am the seed giving father. So the origin of all the species is not material nature but actually the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And from this we also can understand the eternality of the soul. Now we produce some children and we are very much attached to our children. Why we are attached to our children? Why this tendency is there of producing living entities and getting attached to them, having a tendency to enjoy with them. Because our soul should have this tendency. Please understand, all the tendencies of enjoyment are there within us. Because our source should have this tendency. So we cannot exhibit any features of likes, of dislike, of tasting, of watching, of talking, unless it is not present in our source. So thus our source also should have tendency of loving their children. And here Lord Krishna is telling you are all my children. And what is the nature of Lord Krishna? Pralayana vyatanticha sarge no pajayante. Krishna does not take birth at the time of creation. Krishna's body is not destroyed at the time of dissolution. So just like the parents love their children so much, Krishna also loves us so much. And we don't like that our children should die. Similarly Krishna also wishes we do not die. So thus we are eternal. Because Krishna desires we should not die. And all the energies are under control of Krishna. Living entities cannot die because we are children of God. And any capable person would like to save their children from death. And Krishna is supreme capable. God is supreme capable person. All the energies are under control of God. So God loves his children. God does not want his children to die. So thus no power in the world can make the children die. The children also are eternal. But what is this death that we experience? That is simply because of hallucination. Just like we dream and we fall from the mountain in dream and we think I am dead. Now in a similar fashion, because of false ego we identify with the body and we think I am dying and I am taking birth. But when we realize our true nature, I understand I'm eternal. So this is another way by which we can understand that I am eternal. We understand the species cannot come on its own, just like an automobile cannot come on its own. It needs a creator. And Creator is controller of all energies. Creator should be eternal. We are controlled by energies. Our bodies are destroyed and created. So that eternal creator produces some children. And those children also should be eternal. Because we have tendency of always keeping our children with us eternally, we don't wish them to die. So thus we can understand that we are also eternal living beings. So we are eternal and we have taken this body. Even though this body may die. Lord Krishna tells a sober person should not get disturbed. So this is what is the understanding of all the species and this is the origin of species, how the species have come. Krishna gives the soul. Bodies are given by the nature for our enjoyment. But why there is variation among the species? That is because of these three modes of nature. Now, how the three modes of nature impact the living entity to create so many forms that we see around us, that we will see gradually in the upcoming verses. So these verses are very important. If we have to rise above the modes of nature, we have to experience freedom in our life. So this is very, very scientific description, what we are going to understand. So please don't miss these coming classes. We are going to analyze very, very nicely. So people think that this happiness which I want, it is in some object, it is in something. So Krishna explains here happiness is not because of any object. Happiness is not because of any position. Happiness is because of some energy which is called satvaguna. Simply, if we have the satvic energy within our body, person is very, very happy. So the disturbance in our life is not because of some person, disturbance is not because of some system. Disturbance is not because of some substance. Disturbance in our life is simply because of one mode of nature which is called Rajas. Similarly, the helplessness in our life, the moroseness in our life, is not because of a broken relationship. It is not because of very stressful life. It is not because of some substance or so many other things which we can conceive of. It is because of one energy which is called tamogona. So thus it is very, very scientific understanding which Lord Krishna is going to give. Now, in the coming verses. So we will analyze this very nicely how these three energies capture a living entity and different bodies are produced, and how we can using these energies rise above this nature, control of material nature. So that we will see in the next session. For now, let us practice this Hare Krishna Mahamantra, which is the easiest way of surpassing the influence of three modes of nature in Kalya.
