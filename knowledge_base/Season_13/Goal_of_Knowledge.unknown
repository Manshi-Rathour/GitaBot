So in Gyan yoga there are few very important terms. So first of all we have to understand what is knowledge itself. We are discussing so much about acquiring knowledge. What is knowledge? So that Krishna explained and after that it was asked to Krishna please explain the process of knowledge. So the process of knowledge also lord Krishna described very beautifully come pricing of 20 items which we studied in previous session and even prior to that. Now today Lord Krishna is going to explain gayam Yatat Pravakshami gayam is what is knowable. There is the knower and the process of acquiring knowledge. Knowledge itself and the knowable. So let us see the wonderful analysis given by Lord Krishna. Verse number 13. Please try to read from the screen. Gayam Yatat pravakshami Yajyatwamritamashnut anadimatparam Brahmha Nasatanasadochyate I shall now explain the knowable knowing which you will taste the eternal. This is beginningless and it is subordinate to me. It is called Brahm the Spirit. And it lies beyond the cause and effect of this material world. So these words are very very important. We have to see very very carefully. We want to explore internet. There is Internet Explorer. We want to explore the ocean. We want to explain the surface of the earth. We want to go beneath the surface, within the oceans. And some people are even telling today we know more about the space than we know about our ocean. The depths of the ocean are even more difficult to access. But actually Lord Krishna very beautifully describes here two words shetra and Gya. Shetra means field and shetrakya means knower of the field. So two words Krishna has described shetra and Gya. Field means just like we have field, farm or some plot of land. Field also means influence till where the energy spread. So there is something which is called field. And the knower of the field Krishna has not mentioned. Arjuna is not asking the doer of the field or XYZ knower of the field. So thus this drives home very important point. First is that we are not the doers. We are simply the knowers. This life carries us through certain experiences. Just like we have sat in a train there is certain very small free will given to us. We can choose in which train should I sit. Now once you board the train sometimes a train will pass through pleasant scenes and you enjoy those scenes. Sometimes unpleasant scenes or foul smell can come that also you have to tolerate in a similar fashion as per the activities of previous life. We get qualified to enter certain kind of compartment, certain kind of yantra or machine. Some compartments are very good AC first class. Some compartments are not so good economy class or the general class basis. What we can afford such a suitable machine is offered to us. Now we are sitting in this machine of this body and this vehicle is taking us through various so called good and bad experiences of this life. So we are simply the knowers. So the material nature is doing everything. Prakrite kriyamarani gunai karmani sarvashah. Ahankar, vimodhatma. But Vimodatma, the foolish living entity thinks I am the doer. I do not do. Yes, definitely. Somebody may ask then why do I get the results of my activities? I get results of my activities because I am passive actor. I am not the active doer. The nature forces me to do certain activities and in other forms of life we are helpless. But to follow the dictates of the nature, animal will be forced to eat certain kind of food. Animal does not have choice. Tiger can starve but cannot eat grass. They have no freedom. How much ever the animals may be suffering, they cannot invent technology to make a nice house for themselves. They have to suffer and go through those living conditions. They don't have much free will. But as human being we have certain free will and thus we get the results of our activities. Now, if we use our free will very nicely, we can get complete freedom from being carried in such so called good or bad forms. Actually, all these forms, material forms are bad source of all suffering. But we are simply the knower of the field. We have to understand. We are not the knower of the ocean, we are not the knower of the mountains, we are not the knower of space, we are not knower of any other person's, situation or XYZ anything whatsoever. Simply we are the knower of this field. We are called gya. We are not called absolute knowers. We are knowers of everything. No, we are called Shetragya. Now there are two kinds of knowers as we saw in the first lecture of this chapter. Krishna tells us the soul is Shetragya, knower of the field. And there is another knower, Sarva Shetreshubharata, who is conscious of all the fields. That is super soul, that is God. But as far as our knowledge is concerned, we can only have knowledge of this field. So there is no question of us exploring the world, understanding what the world is, what the people are or XYZ. We cannot understand anything but this field as we have discussed many times before. So just if a person analyzes the words nicely, entire picture becomes very clear. The sun is called putra in Sanskrit. What is the meaning of Putra? Pun nam no narcat triathutra. So the entire purpose of having a son is clear why people were so eager to have son? Because Pun nam no narkatra, there are bound to be some sinful actions in this life, knowingly or unknowingly. And then a person, if he is ignorance or cannot atone for those activities. Just like if you break some laws of nature, we don't pay the penalty, then we'll be put behind the bars. So if a person does not atone, we commit some mistakes. There are atonement processes described for it. That is why there are Sanskaras. People take to various pilgrimages and at the time of death they donate cow and they taste Ganges water and tulsi. Where Kantimala? So many things are there. So these are easy things in Bhakti yoga. Otherwise regularly atonement is very very tough. So we have to undergo through all these atonements to clean ourselves from the effects of sinful actions. But if you do not do that we will go to hell. And who can save us from hell? Once we have gone to hell we cannot do any activities. But one person can save us. The son has this power. If the son does the right activity son offers pinda to the forefathers. Prasadam of Lord Vishnu to the forefathers is offered. Then they can get freedom from the hellish conditions or ghostly situations. So thus people were very very eager to have son. Because daughter anyway belongs to other family. She goes to other family. Son can deliver you. Of course daughters also if they follow Krishna consciousness then they also can deliver their family members both sides. But otherwise if Krishna consciousness is not followed then the sun has to offer penda and the sun can deliver them from the hell. So simply if a person understands the meaning why sun is called putra everything is clear. The existence of hell is clear. The purpose of having a sun is clear. And thus it is told everything is so clear. Sansar. This world is called Sansar. Sansar has come from Sansriti? Sansriti means cycle of repeated birth and death. So this world is called Sansar. It has got a great meaning. This is a place where repeated birth and death happens. We are trapped in this cycle in this way every word carries mansa mam sakhadati ITI mansa. Meat is called meat does not convey any meaning. But Mamsa means mam SA Kadati. As I am eating you, you will eat me next life. So next life is clear. Laws of karma are clear. So this is called Sanskrit language. Sanskrit means most reformed the perfect language. So simply if we understand here field and the knower of the field then everything becomes clear. I cannot know anything in this world. Small living entity. The spirit, soul all of us can but know our fields. We live in community. Some people want fan or AC. Some people want heater. Somebody's telling it is too cold. Somebody's telling it is hot. I want fan. There are difference of experiences of temperature. And we have discussed ample number of times. When we are sick we tell the food is bitter. So I am not tasting food. I can never tell what is a taste of food. I can only tell what my tongue is experiencing. I am the knower of this field. I can tell the blue light is falling on my eyes. Whether that object is actually blue. I do not know whether that object actually exists. I do not know, but I am experiencing blue light on my eyes within this field. That's it. So there is gross field, there is subtle field. When we sleep at night, we are unaware of the gross field. We are just aware of the subtle field. So I can just tell what I am experiencing in this field. I can never tell what is reality. So as long as we are under the influence of field, that is why there are so many opinions. Because every person has perception of the world basis one's own field. Thus there are arguments, fights, because it is all right to disagree, because all of us perceive things in a certain way. In this material world. The field Tamsik field does not allow a person to understand God, the supreme personality of Godhead. The Tamsik and Rajeshik fields make sense gratification material, sense enjoyment as the ultimate aim of life. That is perceived as a perfect thing, a child's body. So thumbsick does not know anything beyond food. Simply you give child food and that's it. So thus we have to understand how wonderful this knowledge is. The beginning of Jnana yoga. These words itself are so powerful. Shetra and GNA there is field and we are knowers of the field. So thus it is told, if you have to have actual knowledge, you have to surpass the influences of this field. This field creates six kinds of influences forces Vegas within the body. VA cho vegam manasakro devagam Jivva vegam udhrapas the vegam the force to talk tongue unnecessarily wants to talk. So you analyze in a day the speech which I am producing. Is this speech helpful for my advancement in Krishna consciousness? And we'll analyze many times it is not, but we cannot stop it. We keep on talking. Manasa krodh vegam Jivva vegam there is force of jiva. We want to taste various things. Thus, so many businesses are there, restaurant, food industry, they are making so much of money, the delivery companies. We cannot control tongue. VA cho vegam manasakro the vegam five star hotels, restaurants. Person works very hard. An entire day salary they would spend like anything just to satisfy the tongue. And there is more dangerous vega, that is udharopastha vegam, the force of the genitals. People sacrifice half of their life's wealth just to enjoy this pleasure. The richest people are filing divorce just to enjoy the pleasure of udharopastha vegam. They don't mind half of what they have earned in life, that is gone. But I want to enjoy udhurapastha vegam, the force of reproductive organs. So in this way, the senses are driving us crazy. So only a person who is able to tolerate the influences of this field, such a person can actually perceive the reality of this world. Thus, the Vedic culture trains a person very nicely to come to the platform of at least Brahmana. Brahma janati brahmana brahmana means always happy. In every situation. Person is not dependent upon other things and that is called knowledge ya Vidyasa vimuktaya which liberates a person. Not that after knowledge I have a lifestyle in which I have to spend ten lakh rupees every month. Now I am dependent on money. Earlier I was independent, I was managing with Rs1000 or Rs10,000 in a month. Now my advancement is I become better slave of this world. Now I need ten lakh rupees for my sustainance. So knowledge has made a fool of me rather than giving me liberation and happiness. So in this way, if you don't read Bhagavad Gita, we'll make a fool of ourselves. In the name of getting knowledge we are cultivating ignorance. So thus what is the process of knowledge? Lord Krishna has explained if you missed the session, please read the previous verses eight through twelve. Hear the lecture Lord Krishna describes this is the process of acquiring real knowledge. Amanitram adam bitwam Ahinsa shantir Arjavam this is the process of subduing the Vegas of the field, surpassing the influence of the field which the body is creating. When the body is no longer affecting us, the soul sitting within the body, when the body is completely spiritualized free from the forces of nature, then we can actually understand what is reality. And without knowing reality, who is happy? We have to understand what is real and then follow the path of real. We have to understand what are the real laws of this state and then I have to follow the laws. Then I won't be a criminal and I won't be punished. So simply because of ignorance of these laws, ignorance of reality we are suffering and what we are tasting here is temporary pleasures. Puna punasta Charvitha charvananam so Srimad Bhagavatam describes the knower of the field is always knowing about the field. But the field is not the knowable. Although the knower is always knowing the field, the field is not the knowable. What is knowable that Lord Krishna explains here the knowable is actually the knower of the field. So the knower should not waste his entire life simply knowing the field. But yes, knowledge of field is also important. If I do not know how to keep the body fit, how to get proper food and rest for the body, health for the body, the knowable shall never be known. So this human field is very very rare. We can use this field human field to understand the knower of the field. So there are two knowers of the field and they are called gayam, the knowable. So ultimately we have to cultivate knowledge of the field and of the knower of the field. That is called actual knowledge. But the knowable is not the field. We have to have knowledge of the field so that we can know the knowable. And the knowable is soul why the knowable is soul why I can just delight in the pleasures given by the field. I will just know the experiences of my eyes and I will create good experiences for my eyes. I will just know the sensation of my skin. I will create good experiences of the skin. No, that is not possible. All these pleasures are temporary. They are like enjoying the coolness of the body of snake. So a person can mistake snake's body for a very cool garland. If a person garlands himself with snake then the effect is fatal. Because the snake apart from its very nice pleasing cold body is having very poisonous fangs. And that is the nature of all these senses. This enjoyment, material enjoyment is only creating so many miseries and death for living entities life after life. So thus Lord Krishna tells if you have knowledge of gayam if you know the knowable and the knowable is actually the knower of the field who is conscious of this field we have to know that entity. And if we know that then what happens? Yaj Gyatwa Amritam Ashnut I shall now explain the knowable knowing which you will taste the eternal. So now we are just tasting temporary pleasures here. But we are eternal. So we want a pleasure which is also eternal. I want to always have good experience in my life. It should not last only for a fraction of minute or seconds. I want this good experience to continue. Thus people want to keep on eating. People want to keep on enjoying physical pleasures. But there is limitation, so many limitations in material world we cannot continue so that is possible on the spiritual platform. Such pleasure we can relish only when we are having knowledge of the knowable. And what is that knowable? Lord Krishna explains anadi mat param brahma nasat tan NASAD ochyate anadimat param Brahmha. It is called brahm the spirit. This is beginningless and it is subordinate to me. Some people tell that Brahmagyan is topmost gyan so Krishna is telling no math param Brahma the brahmagyan knowledge of spirit is subordinate to me. I am the source of all that spirit which is all pervading. Anadhi Matam Brahma nasata nasat Uchate so as some people tell the spirit this consciousness the effect of matter, combination of matter. So here Lord Krishna is telling the supreme authority nasat Tan Nasat Uchate it is Sat means cause and ASAT. Sat and ASAT means cause and effect. So it is beyond sat and ASAT cause and effect. So material world just comprises of cause and effect. The seed is the cause of the tree and then the seed vanishes. And then the tree produces some fruit and the tree may vanish. That fruit may produce another tree. So in this way cause and effect that may produce cotton and then fruit vanishes. Then cotton comes out in the form of thread. Cotton vanishes. Threat is stitched in the form of shirt. Cotton vanishes and then shirt gets transformed into dirt. Shirt vanishes and then dirt may transform into something else. In this way cause and effects are happening in this world cause vanishes, effect comes into picture. Then that effect is the cause of some other effect. In this way endless cycle of cause and effect that is called this material world sat ASAT but Nasat NA Asad the Spirit soul is beyond cause and effect. So Spirit Soul is not the result of any combination of matter. That is a verdict of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Krishna. So that knowledge of Spirit soul Lord Krishna is going to explain here. So there are two spirits. Infinitesimal Spirit and Infinite Spirit. Soul. Individual souls all of us who are knower of the individual fields and Supreme Spirit Super Soul who is the knower of all the fields that knowledge Lord Krishna is going to explain now. So cultivating knowledge of just this field will not give us eternal pleasure. We have to cultivate knowledge. We have to understand the knower of the field. Individual knower as well as the supreme knower. If we are able to know that, then amritam ashnut we enjoy everlasting happiness. So Lord Krishna explained here the knowledge of infinitesimal soul. And that is Anadimat Param Brahma. That is subordinate to the knowledge of Supreme Soul. Now Krishna is explaining knowledge of Supreme Soul. Saravata panipadam tas saravatokshi shiromukam saravata SHUTi Maloke sarvama vrityatishtati. Everywhere are his hands and legs, his eyes and faces and he hears everything. In this way, the super soul exists. So when people tell that God has got no forms they should read such shlokas in bhagavad gita Sarvato Panipadam Tas Sarvatokshi Shiro Mukham pani means hands and Padam means legs. Sarvataha means everywhere. Everywhere are his hands and legs. Panipadam sarva taha akshi shiro mukham his eyes and faces are also spread everywhere. Sarvatashruti malloke. Here is everything. Sarvam Avritati in this way the super soul exists. So God is having many many eyes, many many faces, many many hands and legs. So who is telling that God is formless? So how do we understand that God is having many many eyes? And what does this exactly mean? So it means so many species exist here with hands, legs, faces and eyes. All of us, the living entities, man and even animals, fishes, all the species of life. So all these hands and legs we have to understand do not belong to us. This machine we do not know how to create and how to maintain it and how to efficiently destroy it. This process is being set by Lord Krishna Supreme Personality. So he knows how to create this body, how to maintain this body. So that is why he is the proprietor. He has created all these things and it has been given to us. This world is a simulation. That is why it is called Maya. Maya means that which is not. So we see here man, woman, trees and animals. So that is not fact. We have simply taken coverings machines upon ourselves. If somebody goes and sits inside a robot which looks like a man. And that could be a woman sitting inside or operating that robot. And similarly there could be a she robot which looks like a female and there could be a male person sitting inside that and operating it. Now if the male robot gets attracted to female robot so that is foolishness. Or we have sometimes we create Mickey Mouse family. One person is having dress of Mickey Mouse, one person is having dress of Minnie Mouse, somebody is having dress of Pluto. But they don't become actually Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse. Their actual form is completely different. So this is called maya. I am seeing such forms. But those forms are not reality. The real form is of the spirit soul which is sitting inside the machines. So now externally the forms that we see and not just the gross forms, the voice that we hear, the behavior that we see, good behavior, bad behavior, angry mood, pleasant mood, sense control, loose senses, all these are the features of the machine. Now unfortunately we come, we are traveling in this various machines and then we create a world here and we get attached to this world. So when we get attached to the movies that we create, we start laughing and crying. When we get attached to the computers, games that we create, no wonder that how can we help getting attached in this world? In this virtual reality which is created by God himself. So God is a perfect creator. Thus this virtual reality appears very real because it is created by God. He is the best simulator. So thus this world is Maya, a simulation. Now in this simulation we get attached to various machines, various forms which are not real. So thus we get carried away and we start thinking I am these forms. Krishna creates this hallucination. But that is not fact. An intelligent person, if he is able to purify his machine by contacting Lord Krishna or his pure devotees, then we understand this machine. I am different from this machine. And this machine belongs to. So now because so many hands and legs of various machines are there spread throughout the universe, all these hands and legs belong to God. Thus this verse mentions his hands, legs, eyes, ears are everywhere. Because all of our hands, legs, eyes, ears, they belong to God. So thus happiness lies when we accept this fact. The peace formula. We all want peace in our life. The peace formula is explained at the end of fifth chapter of Bhagavad Gita. And that is Sarva loko Maheshwaram suryadam sarva Bhutanam gyatma mam shanti mashati. We have to understand. Sarvaloka Maheshwaram. Krishna is a supreme proprietor controller of everything. So if we start using our hands, legs, eyes, limbs simply for the pleasure of Krishna, then we start getting immediately so much pleasure in my life immediately as soon as we surrender to Krishna. So just we have to factually realize this fact that our body, our mind and we also belong to Krishna. Further. Lord Krishna explains sarvendriya gunabhasam saravendriya vivarjitam asaktam sarva bhatchaiva nirgunam guna bhoktracha. So these explanations are very important. If we understand factually these explanations then we will taste the eternal. So what is the further description of the supersol? Sarvendria Gunabhasam? The super soul is the original source of all senses. It's clear. We have not created. So God has created SuperSoul has created. Yet he is without senses. He is unattached. Although he is the maintainer of all living beings, he transcends the modes of nature. And at the same time he is the master of all modes of material nature. Sarveendriya Gunabhasam sarvendriya Vivarjitam. So if a person does not have proper knowledge, they may develop an impersonal understanding. So here it is mentioned god does not have indria Saravindriya Vivarjitam he is without any senses. But we have to understand. Without senses means without the senses of this world material senses. So materialize these are gadgets which are required for us to perceive the things in this material world. But Krishna does not need these gadgets. He has indriya. But he does not need these materialized material senses. So thus it is told sarve Indria Viverajatam krishna does not have material senses. Just like we describe ghosts as being formless. So ghosts are not formless. But the form is not visible to us. So we tell ghosts are formless. In a similar fashion, ghosts are having subtle body of mind intelligence and false ego. And the spirit is even subtler than mind, intelligence, false ego. That Krishna is going to explain now in coming verses that we are not able to understand the gyna knower of the field because it is very very subtle. So when we cannot even perceive mind and intelligence and they have got form, the ghosts are having form which is made of three subtle energies mind, intelligence and false ego. And advanced personalities. Can see. Prabhupada was chilling. So Prabhupada took a haunted building which nobody would take in Calcutta. Prabhupada got it throwaway prices. And then Prabhupada went there. He chanted around the building. Ghost went away. Then it never disturbed. Otherwise the servants were afraid that sir, you have taken this building. Plates are flying around in there in this place. So Prabhupada told I am ghost proof, do not worry. And then Prabhupada told ghost was sitting in this place. Especially near the gate. And in other such places also. So Prabhupada could see and advanced personalities can see. So mind, intelligence, false ego it has got a form. But we cannot see those forms. So spirit soul, which is much more subtler, how we can see. But the soul has got form. But in our reference it is called invisible. Just like for a colorblind person, he perceives green as brown. If you want him to get green vegetables, you please tell him get brown vegetables. Otherwise if you tell him green, he'll purchase blue or something else. So thus spiritual knowledge is being explained in our context at times. So thus from our context Krishna does not have the senses that we have got mundane senses. So that is why he's called Indria Viverjitam. Krishna has got no form, no mundane form. Krishna has got spiritual form. Krishna is not visible to us. So thus he is also called formless at times. So in our context the thing is being explained. So thus there is no contradiction in this. But we have to understand in our context things are being explained. Sarvindria gunabha sam Sarvendria. Vivarjitam Asaktam Sarva. Brit Chaywa nirgunam guna Bhoktarcha he is not attached to anybody. Still he maintains everybody. We maintain some people because we are attached to them. Krishna is not attached to anybody, still he maintains nirgunam Guna Bhoktaracha and Krishna is controller of the gunas Satvaguna, Rajaguna and Tamuguna. But he is nirgun. Nirgun means he is not affected by these three. Gunas bahirantas chabutanamacharam. Charamacha sukshmatwatad aviyam duras thamchanti ke chat bahirantas chabhutanam. The supreme truth exists both internally and externally. So people tell God is there inside, why you are going outside? No, he is outside also. So perfect knowledge of God means seeing God within and seeing God without. If a person sees only without, doesn't see God within, then that is also called Neophyte Prakrit Bhakta Archa Yam Avaharaye a person who worships very nicely the archa incarnation of Lord Krishna in the temple Natak bhakteshu Chanyeshu. But he does not appreciate the same God living within the heart of all the other people who are there in the temple, who are the devotees and he does not give respect to other people. Then such a person is called Prakrit Bhakta, a Neophyte devotee on the material platform. Only out of good faith. Somebody has told him this is God in the altar. So he's worshipping. But he is not able to appreciate the same God sitting within the heart of everybody. Thus it is told a proper spiritualist a devotee offers respect to all living entities at all times. As soon as we see the temple, we offer respect seeing the temple even from outside. Because temple is the house of Lord. In a similar fashion, every body should be seen as temple of Lord and should be offered respect at all times. All the bodies, man bodies, animal bodies, trees bodies. Because Krishna is seated as supersol sarvamridhi vishtitam that also Lord Krishna explains. So the super soul is situated within the heart of all the bodies. So all the bodies should be seen as temple. So if a person simply sees God outside, not within, then there is no proper knowledge of God. Simply sees God within, does not see God or that is stone in the temple. God is within the heart. What you are doing, that is also improper understanding. God is present antar Bahil Avastitam he is situated within and without. But Maya Javanika chandam agyadokshajam avyayam he's. Covered by the influence of his internal potency. And thus he is not revealed to everybody. Although God is present outside, God is present within also. But he covers himself from the people who are envious of God who want to compete with God. He is never exposed to such people. So super soul is existing without within every atom and existing within the body also. Acharam Charamacha he is present in moving beings. He is present in non moving beings also. He is present in stones also. He is present within every atom also. Acharam Charamacha sukshmatva Tad Avigyayam he is beyond the power of material senses. Avigyayam he is unknowable. So the actual knowable object is unknowable to us in the material platform. Why? Because it is sukshmatvat. It is very very subtle. And we can understand subtle things. Now the song is traveling in the air invisible. It enters my phone, isn't it? We can just transfer electronically the songs and everything we can have from other phone or from internet or from anywhere. Our gross voice we can record and we can send it there somewhere. So sound is traveling. The video form is traveling. But we are not able to see the form in the air. When tenders the device, we are able to see the form. So the form, the sounds are traveling in a subtle way. We cannot see them. In a similar fashion, the super soul God is existing in a very subtle way. Because it is sukshmatva. That is very very subtle. Induction cooker fire is there. We cannot see. It is very subtle. So sukshmatva. So how subtle is the supreme Spirit? Material energies themselves are so subtle. Gross sound and vision and touch. So what to speak of Spirit? So thus Spirit is not knowable to us because of being very very subtle. Duras tham chante ke chatat. Now this is also contradictory. Duras Tham he's far away and he's very very near also. So all these things can be perfectly adjusted. On the spiritual platform the space time have influence upon us. The living entities on spiritual platform, they don't exert their influence. Thus Lord Krishna as well as the living entities who are on the platform of Lord Krishna who can reach that platform krishna will explain now in coming verses. So that is called absolute platform. For them, time and space have no conditioning. So thus we should not doubt how to take instructions from Srila Prabhupada. Srila Prabhupada disappeared so many years ago. No time and space they do not stop the activities and presence of God and people who are on the platform of God. Spiritual platform, liberated platform. Thus Prabhupal told just like relay monitoring even a gross person. Just like I am sitting in one place but I can communicate to all of you everywhere. So can spiritual master not do that? Just understand, isn't it? When I can do that, we can surpass the limitations of space. Can spiritual master not do that. Spiritual spirit soul is always existing. That is a fact. NA Jayatachit. So we also are always existing. And liberated personalities are also always existing. Now what is the difference between existence of liberated personalities and conditioned souls like us? We are prone to forgetfulness. And the liberated personalities are never into forgetfulness. Thus it is told. Chakshudan Dilo JanMay JanMay Prabhusay so spiritual Master who gives us the eyes of knowledge by which we are able to appreciate all this wonderful knowledge he is my Spiritual master. Life after life. At the time of death we'll forget that these were my father, my mother, my children, my dog, my family members. I have to maintain them. I have to take care of them. We forget completely. They may be suffering in so many other forms. People I was loving in previous life I am completely ignorant of them. Material nature makes me forgetful. But spiritual masters, they are eternal. Death does not make them forgetful. They are conscious of their disciples life after life unless they are able to liberate them. So understood. It is very simple. So we being material personalities can communicate our message to the people we desire. Space is not matter for us. Similarly, Spiritual Master is also existing somewhere in this world. It does not matter how far he is. When materially, we can transmit a message millions of miles immediately. It does not matter why Spiritual master cannot if he wants and he wants, they are not captured by ignorance. They are liberated personalities. So where is the question of coming in ignorance? I should have a physical body. Then you take guidance. No. So spiritual Master Prabhupada explained thus, it is important to understand this guru Tattva. Otherwise we will not be able to develop faith. And without faith how can we have knowledge? If you do not have faith in the train counter or train website you will never be able to book ticket and board the train or where my money is going. Will I be able to get actual ticket or not? No. So that is why faith is required. Then you purchase the ticket, you have faith in doctor. Then you open your heart for surgery. You agree to become unconscious. So such faith is required. With this faith when we take the instruction of Spiritual Master, we advance. So thus we should understand the science of spiritual existence very clearly. Duras tham chanti ke chat. There is no difference for Lord Krishna. He may be miles away but is very close as well. Immediately so this is how Lord Krishna and his devotees exist. Avi Bhaktam Chabhutam Mevachasthitam Bhuta Bhartra Chataj gayam grasseshnu prabhavishnocha although the super soul appears to be divided sorry, he is never divided. So in every heart, in every body there is SuperSoul. It means there is division. One super soul is there in my heart. Another supersol is in other person's heart. So two different personalities are there? No. Although the supersol appears to be divided. It is not divided just like the same sun is reflected in millions of reservoirs of water or the same sun is visible in millions of cities. It does not mean the sun has got divided into as many cities, so many suns. The same sun is visible in different cities. It is not divided. In a similar fashion, super soul is visible in our heart. Although it appears to be divided, it is not divided. All this is possible on spiritual platform. Vivakta Mivachasitam he is situated as if divided, but he is not divided. Bhuta Bhatra chattaj Gayam although he is maintainer of every living entity, it is to be understood that he grashnu, he devours also and prabhavishnu he develops also. So the super soul is the maintainer and the super soul in the form of time also devours all the living entities and it creates also new bodies for the living entities. So the creation, maintenance and destruction all this is under the control of supersol. Joti shamapitajyotis tamasaf paramuchate ganam gayam gyanagamyam ridi sarvasya Vishtitam he is the source of light in all luminous objects. He is beyond the darkness of matter and is unmanifested. He is knowledge. He is the object of knowledge and he is the goal of knowledge. He is situated in everyone's heart. So we have sun as the source of light in this world. But from where sun is getting its light it is getting from the Supreme Personality of Godhead all the bodies which emit light. Jyotisham apita Jyoti he is the source of illumination for all the bodies. Thomas of Param Uchyate he is beyond the darkness of matter. This material world is dark. You need external illumination to see things here. But Supreme Personality of God it is beyond the darkness of matter. Gyanam gayam Gyanagamyam so there are these three things there is something called knowledge and there is something to be known object of knowledge. So any substance salt can be called object of knowledge. And then we know the salt. The knowledge is it is salty. We have that knowledge of experience of that substance. So there is knowable substance. There is knowledge of the substance and then there is object of knowing that getting that knowledge. What is the object of getting that knowledge? These people do not know. So that is why it is called vidya bhagavata vadhi. The ultimate object of all knowledge is to understand Bhagavatam dharma swanishta punsam Vishwak seyna kathasuya know the padhe the Rathim yadishram ultimate object of all the activities of all the duties in getting all knowledges to develop attraction to hear the knowledge of Krishna because that brings ultimate happiness and liberation to all the living entities. So we think object of knowledge is getting money. So if I'm able to make money, let me not continue my education. And there's people who become good famous cricketers they leave their jobs or famous celebrities they leave their studies they ignore it. So if I am getting money immediately, why to continue study? I want fame. I am having fame and recognition. Why to continue it? So people think knowledge of the object of knowledge is mundane enjoyment, name, fame, XYZ. But no. What is Gyan gammyam? What is the ultimate end of knowledge? What we are supposed to accomplish by knowledge that is again SuperSoul itself god Himself. So thus God is knowledge, god is the knowable and God is the object of all knowledge. So in that sense everything is God. God and his energies. God expands Himself as knowledge as the knowable and as the object of knowledge. And where God is situated, SuperSoul is situated ridhi sarvasiya vistitam. So the supreme personality of God He is situated in Golokrindavan. But here the knowledge is being explained about Gyna, the knower of the field. And that is ridhi sarvasiya vishtitam. So that knower of the field, the supreme knower is situated within the heart. Riddhi sarvasi vishtitam. There are some philosophies still soul is there within the eyebrows. Some people tell we do not know from where they have concocted. Very clearly it is mentioned riddhi in the heart. Riddhi sarvaskitam atma anuranyan Sam anuranyan mahato Mahayan atmasi Jantur nihito guhayam guhayam in the heart. Riddhi in the heart. So the soul is situated in the heart. Then Lord Krishna explains itikshetram tata Gyanam gayam choktum Samasatah madh bhakta very important. Etad viya madhbaya upapadyate. So very important. Lord Krishna explains thus the field of activities that is called Shetram and then Tata gnanam knowledge and the knowable have been summarily described by Me. So we want to know the intricacies of this body. We want to have all the knowledge of this world or whatever we can acquire. And we wish to have knowledge of that consciousness. Those who are advanced, who can perceive the presence. So Lord Krishna tells only one set of people can understand this knowledge thoroughly. And who are they? Krishna explains Only Madh Bhaktaha, my devotee can understand this agnani whose aim of life is just to cultivate knowledge. He cannot get perfect knowledge. So Agnani on the path of his Gyana will realize the ultimate truth is personality of Godhead. And I have to love that personality, engage in loving service of that personality. So thus Yogi cannot know, gnani cannot know, karmi cannot know. Who can know who can have perfect knowledge of reality? Krishna very clearly here mentions only my devotee can have this knowledge. So thus simply engaging our senses in the loving service of Krishna enlightens us to perfect knowledge. And if we don't engage ourselves in the service of Krishna which begins with the tongue save on Mukeshi jivvada adam is beginning. The beginning of service to God is chanting his names Jivha and tasting Prasadam remnants of Krishna. So we should be very strict. I will not taste anything which is not offered to Krishna. And I will always chant the names of krishna and I will preach Krishna consciousness discuss Krishna Katha so in this way we start our service to Krishna. And eventually when the tongue is engaged, we can engage hands, legs, mind, intelligence, entire existence in the service of Krishna. And when we are saturated with devotional service. So actually simply following the path of gyana will not help people argue so much. So simply give them the simple logic and then nobody will argue with you ever. This process of acquiring perfection of knowledge by the path of logic is the way of unintelligent people. Why? Because our brains and memory are imperfect. Using your brain, using your intelligence, you want to understand what is truth. But unfortunately in Kaluga we are not intelligent because intelligence works basis the data memory that you have now today, the knowledge we have discussed tomorrow you want to compare this with some other philosophy? We will not be able to compare because we'll forget what we have read. If we just ask what was the previous shloka that we have discussed? Most of us may not remember because we forget it. So thus if I want to read all the philosophies and hear everything and analyze nicely what is truth, I can never analyze because I do not have perfect memory. Only if I have perfect memory shruti dhara then I can keep on storing all the information, all the data. And once I've finished all the knowledge reading all the vedas, then I can understand I have knowledge of all the philosophies. Then I can analyze, compare and come to right conclusion what is fact. But how we can do any analysis? Because the data itself goes away from the mind. So when our memory is not perfect, where is the question of perfect comparison and proper analysis? So it is foolishness to understand truth and base your convictions of life depending what this brain is producing. So we'll simply be convinced about what our surroundings are exposing us to. So thus we are helpless. So Srila Prabhupada explains what knowledge we'll have. So what we have to do is follow simple process what Lord Krishna mentions here. And what is that? Ten chapter verse number ten tesham SATA Yuktanam bhajatam priti purvakam dadami buddhi yogam tam yenamam upayantite ultimately we have to approach Krishna madh bhavai upapadyate. So these devotees who are able to approach me, who are able to approach me how to approach God, how to understand God? So we need not go through very gradual process of acquiring knowledge over millions of lives. Neither that is possible with our limited intelligence. Now so Krishna tells those who are constantly engaged in my service SATA Yuktanam we are saturated with seva. Our hands are moving just for the service of Krishna. Our eyes are moving just for the service of Krishna. Tongue is tasting just for the service of Krishna. Intelligence is working just for the service of Krishna. When we are saturated every moment of the day is just for the service of Krishna. Then Krishna talks to such a devotee, he gives instructions from the heart and he gives guidance. How we can approach God in this way? We approach God. We approach the nature of God. Nature of God is Sachidananda. God is eternal, full of knowledge and full of bliss. And when we engage ourselves in the service of Krishna, madh Bhakta Etat Vikyaya so even when people were very wise and shruti dharas, they also have to become bhakta to know Krishna. Because God is a person, no person exposes himself to another person who is not interested in any relationship with the person. So only living entities who want to have loving relationship with God, god gives knowledge of himself. So thus Krishna tells Mad bhakta ethat vikyaya. So in Bhagavad Gita it is so clear. In ten verses of chapter number twelve last verses we have seen Madh Bhakta only devotee can know me, bhakta is dear to me. Again Krishna is telling. So actually in Bhagavad Gita there is nothing but devotional service. But people who do not read and other such followers who have no time to read, who are busy and enjoying Charvitha, charvananam mundane material pleasures which actually don't give any satisfactory pleasure to heart, are not able to understand. So thus I request, let us take this realization of Bhagavad Gita very seriously. It should not be just kept in theory, but we should engage all our limbs, senses in the service of Krishna. And then let us realize, let us also become eternal, all knowing and full of bliss. So more such wonderful discussion we will have in the next class. Thank you so much for hearing. Now we will do most important process and that is engaging practically in the service of Krishna. So those devotees who are new, this process is very very simple. Simply by following this process, everything we will understand, we'll understand knower of the fields, we will understand the knowledge, we will understand all the items of knowledge. Everything would be clear. We'll understand who is God, who we are, what is this world. Everything would be revealed simply by chanting this hare Krishna, Mahamantra Hare Namiyev Kavalam we should have faith. The more faith we have, the more Holy Name is a person. So the more Krishna tells Yayatam prapadhyante if you are faithless that this is stone here, this is just mundane vibration. So this vibration incarnation of Krishna will never reciprocate. And the more we have faith, the more there would be reciprocation from God. So thus we should try to chant very faithfully even though our faith could be very very. But if you are hearing regularly, you will have some amount of decent faith. So using that faith, please try to chant and there is no loss. So experiment, the knowledge would be revealed automatically. We'll understand everything by chanting. So please chant as much as possible throughout the day what you have to do is 16 words. Hari Krishna. Hari Krishna. Krishna Krishna Hari. Hari. Hari Ram. Hari Ram, Ram, Ram. Hari hari.
