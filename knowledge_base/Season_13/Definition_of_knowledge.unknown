Definition_of_knowledge,"Nature, the enjoyer and consciousness. So in the previous chapter number twelve we have seen how Lord Krishna was asked the direct question which path is superior? Arjuna got convinced that I am not the body and spirit soul and Krishna explained knowledge about himself. So the first six chapters describe the knowledge about the living entity what is the position of the living entity and then the middle six chapters describe the position of God how the living entity is supposed to act in relationship with God and that is the Bhakti Yoga. Now in the final six chapters technically it has been very nicely explained how the living entity has forgotten God comes in contact with the material nature and how technically the living entity can be delivered. So the very beautiful sandwich of Karma Yoga Gyan Yoga and in between Bhakti Yoga has been presented in Bhagavad Gita. So we have seen the chapters of Karma Yoga we have finished Bhakti Yoga and now Gyan Yoga the final six chapters. So let us see verse number one and two arjuna Uvacha Prakritim Purusham Chawakshetram Shetragyami Ganam Gayam Chaka Shri Bhagavanuvacha idam Shariram kante translation arjuna said o my dear Krishna, I wish to know about Prakriti nature purusha then Joyer and the field and the knower of the field and of knowledge and the end of knowledge. The Blessed Lord then said this body, O Son of Kunti, is called the field and one who knows this body is called the knower of the field so why Arjuna is asking these questions? Arjuna is asking Prakriti shetra shetra GNA gyanam gayam because this is what is called knowledge. So we are very fond of reading so many things and people are very very assertive about their opinions and they debate and they state according to me as per me so like this every person thinks that he or she has got lot of knowledge but what is knowledge? Knowledge means knowing things as it is as Srila Prabhupada explains if you know a rope as a snake or a snake as a rope then that is not knowledge, that is ignorance. You may want to take help of a rope to fetch a pail of water but then if you catch hold of a snake that is a big disaster you will lose your life. So in a similar fashion just knowing is not important that I am seeing something in front of me what is the real nature of that thing? So thus there are various philosophies explaining this what is knowledge? So Arjuna is very inquisitive to ask lord Krishna please explain me my Lord, what is knowledge actually? And these because Arjuna is brought up in Vedic culture. So in pursuit of knowledge you are supposed to know these subjects prakriti Purush ishvara so there are innumerable problems in life, in the material world and somebody who tells I do not have problem the disciples ask Prabhupada that Prabhupada sometimes when we present Krishna consciousness to people that you please take it. So people ask why should I take it and then we tell because you'll be happy. So people tell no, I am already very happy. So what should we say in such cases he tells or she tells I am already very happy. I do not need this Krishna consciousness. So Prabhupada explained then they are mad men. Only a person who is thoroughly mad can feel happiness in this world. Because Krishna has designed this world as Dukalyam this place is abode of miseries. Dukhalyam asashwatam Anityam asukam Lokam so when Krishna has designed this as place of misery then we should try to analyze why am I working so hard to become happy. At least I should relax and understand. I can never become happy in this place. Because this place is full of miseries. So immediately I should relax all my material endeavors to become happy. Materially. No one has ever become happy nor shall anyone become happy in this world. Because Krishna has designed this place as Dhukhalayam. Now a person who is very mad then they may not understand the danger and the suffering of this place. Just like animal that is animal mentality. An animal is not able to understand and especially the goats. The goat is being slaughtered and next to it another goat is very busy eating grass. It does not think that my friend is being killed now and my turn is next and all of my friends have been slaughtered in the same way. But simply if you give the goat some grass or food to eat goat is very nicely thinking. This is something very pleasant oh I'm being given grass. Let us enjoy who has seen the future or everybody's dying. I will also die. So if the goat is neglectful then we should not accuse it because that is animal. But in human form of life we are supposed to advance than the intelligence of goats and animals. So anybody who thinks that I am happy such a person should be regarded as thoroughly mad. Because there are so many sufferings here. Morning to evening every step we are struggling to become happy. And God has made this place dukalyam anityamasukam lokam. So feeling depressed and feeling bad here is perfectly normal. But we should not become complacent that it happens to everybody let it happen to me also. Human being means we should have scientific temperament. We should inquire why this thing is happening. Behind creation there is creator. Why creator is punishing me? What is the wrong thing that I have done? So that is why these words are important to understand prakriti purusha ishvara Gyanam gayam. So this word Prakriti is used for material nature. We all understand what is nature. We talk about it. Nature is doing many things. So this material nature is called Prakriti. And what is purush? The living entity the spirit soul is known as Purush. And who is ishwar the controller of both shetragya. So he wants to understand what is prakriti, what is purush, what is field, what is knower of the field, what is knowledge and what is the end of knowledge. So 1 may also wonder that why the purusha from Purusha we mean the living entity here. Because in the 7th chapter, if some of you remember, we discussed Bhumi rapunalo, Vayu, Kammano, Buddhirevacha, Hankariti, Amna, Prakriti, Rashtadha So Krishna has described prakriti material nature as earth, hair, water, fire, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego. These are eight elements which constitute even the basic element of prakriti. These basic eight components create a universe as well as an atom. So it is not that atoms combine together to make water. Rather water is present in the atom. It is not that oxygen is required. Then combustion happens. Then fire happens. Within every oxygen atom there is fire already. And now we understand also that is called nuclear energy fission fusion. There is fire within the atom. So that is why we can derive that out. That is called fission. So just like we have analyzed fire now within the atom by our sciences, one day science may advance to understand. There is not just fire, there is water also within the atom, every atom there is fire. There is water. There is air also. Within every atom an entire Bhagavatam which has got 18,000 verses was explained in just four verses to Lord Brahma. And one of the verses of Chaturushloki Bhagavatam is this. So assimile is presented how Lord Krishna is present outside and he has entered within everything also. The atom also. And it is being described to Lord Brahma. Just like the great elements earth, air, water, fire, sky, they are present outside also. You see earth, you see water, you see sky, you see air. So these are present outside. But these are present within every atom also. So just like the gross elements are present within atom and outside also, they maintain their existence in a similar fashion. Although Krishna, you are existing outside still you enter within every atom in this world. In this way God exists in this existence. So this is one of the most important verses. Only Lord Brahma understood entire Bhagavatam just in four verses. So this is called prakriti. Prakriti means the material nature. It is basically composed of these eight elements. They combine together and produce everything that we see and we do not. Then Krishna had told in the seven chapter of Bhagavad gita upper Ayam itastwanyam Prakritim vidhime param jiva Bhutam mahabaho, there is another Prakriti. Prakritim vidhime param aparayam. Itastu Anyam. There is another superior energy of mine which is transcendental to this material prakriti material energy. And what is that? Jiva bhuta Mahabaho yayedam Dhariyata Jagad Jiva the living entity which is sustaining the worlds. So living entity was called prakriti there. But here living entity is being addressed as Purusha the enjoyer. So how do we understand that prakriti or nature is the meaning is enjoyed. And purusha means enjoyer. So the understanding is actually we are prakriti. Prakriti means energy. So the only purusha is Lord Krishna and rest everybody is prakriti. We may have dress of man or woman or any gender whatsoever but actually we are all prakriti in various forms. We are supposed to be enjoyed by Krishna. Our existence is meant for Krishna's enjoyment. That is our nature. Now when the living entity rebels against its very nature and tries to become Lord Master enjoyer. Thus he is addressed as purusha. Although we are prakriti but our tendency becomes that of enjoyer rather than one that of being enjoyed. Thus the living entity is being addressed as purusha. Here I wish to know about Prakriti. I wish to know about Purusha and I wish to know about the field. Shetra and Shatragna. So this is also very important element of knowledge. So what answer Lord Krishna gives this body O Son of Kunti is called the field. And one who knows this body is called the knower of the field. Just like every citizen in a kingdom is given a field. Earlier factories and corporate offices were not there. So how people would maintain themselves, they were intelligent. They will not work hard and get money and then purchase something which they want. They would directly produce in the field everything that they want. So everything that we want can be produced in the field. And freedom is given to us what we want to sow in the field and thus reap the results. And we are called the knower of the fields. The person who cultivates the field in a similar fashion this body is called the field. The living entity has got its influence within the body and he can derive good or bad experiences from this body. Freedom is given to the living entity. Then Lord Krishna describes now this is also a very important verse. Shetragyam chapimam vidhi sarvakshetreshubharata shetra shetra ganyor gyanam yastajanam matam mama O Sion of Bharat. You should understand that I am also the knower in all bodies. And to understand this body and its knower is called knowledge. That is my opinion. So earlier Lord Krishna explained the living entity as shetragya knower of this field. So we have to understand we are not the controllers, we are the knowers of this field. I know what is happening in my body and I desire. And as per what we desire parmatma facilitate our actions, activities and the living entity whatever it desires, Parmatma gives the chance. Parmatma fulfills all the desires of the living entities are fulfilled. So sometimes our conscience pricks please do not go for this action. But then we reject the inner voice and then we suffer later. So Parmatma begs Prabhupada explains through our good conscience. But we neglect the voice of conscience. And then Parmatma allows okay, I will arrange this situation for you. Although you are going to suffer because you want it. So that you become thoroughly convinced that this is also not going to give you happiness. So that a living entity becomes thoroughly convinced. There is no happiness in any desire. Parmatma keeps on sanctioning the desire. So if the living entity is first class intelligent then simply by hearing one should understand or this kind of desire I should have it is good this I should not have. If a small child foolish it may desire anything and actually it desires everything that is not good for it. So that is why the parents regulate the child very tightly. It may want to eat something which is not very healthy. The child may want to go somewhere where he can meet an accident. Meet with an accident or child may want to play entire day. In this way the child's desires are usually harmful for it. But if the parent's advice is being followed by the children then they can be happy and they can have a nice future also. But if the child sometimes insists a lot then parents may unwillingly allow. In a similar fashion the living entity is being allowed by Parmatma. So that we become thoroughly convinced wherever we go we will not be satisfied. So if you want to become happy then we should take the advice of God and we should give up our programs. All the difficulty in our life is because of this program making. Every living entity keeps on desiring. Parmatma keeps on sanctioning the desire. And even after the desire is achieved we don't become happy. Why? Because actually we are prakriti but we are trying to become purusha. This is very very important point to understand. So if we want to enjoy the things we will never be able to enjoy them. But if we want to give enjoyment to Krishna then we will be able to enjoy always in this way the living entity is related just like the employee is predominated and employer is the predominator. So if the employer dictates any terms employee follows very nicely. Both of them enjoy. The employer will get money. The company will increase and then that money will be given to the good performing employee also. But employee should be submissive. Take the orders, execute the orders and the employer gives the orders. But when they both cooperate then both become happy. But still employer remains employer, employee remains employee. Although happiness is the same activity of service will give happiness to both in a similar fashion. Simply if you become a nice employee of Krishna. Nice servant of Krishna. And Krishna is not an employer of this world. Krishna sells himself to his employee. He becomes a servant of his servants. Krishna became the driver of Arjuna. Krishna became the doorkeeper of Bali maharaj can our boss become our doorkeeper? Our guarding the apartment or liftman or our chauffeur? No, our boss will never do that. But Krishna does that. Infinite God becomes menial, servant of infinitesimal living entities. But still we should agree to abide by the orders of God. It is as simple as that. So now entire day we keep on planning that next quarter this should be my performance. So that I can get this much money, I'll get promoted and then this much appraisal. Then new business or more marks. And then in this way we keep on planning our enjoyment. Then I'll get married and then we will have children. Then we'll get our children married and then we'll get them their children also married and then we'll be happy. We keep on planning. But such planning does not make anyone happy. So activity is not bad. Activity should be for satisfaction of Krishna you marry for satisfaction of Krishna or don't marry for satisfaction of Krishna you eat for Krishna you don't eat. Just like these were festivals Janmashtmi vyas puja day we fasted. So we did not eat for the pleasure of Krishna. And then we had a feast again for the pleasure of Krishna. So when we don't eat it should be for pleasure of Krishna. When we eat should be pleasure of Krishna. When we don't sleep early in the morning for pleasure of Krishna we sleep again for the pleasure of Krishna. So that body becomes rejuvenated for Krishna's service. So in this way simply if we do all the activities always, every moment, entire day if we keep on thinking how do I make Krishna happy after one month, two month, five years, ten years? Just like we have big goals in life we should have big goals for Krishna. After ten years. After 20 years we think I'll be there in a big place and I'll have a boat of my own and maybe a plane of my own. You can have same thing for Krishna let me have an island but for Krishna and let us have a very nice Krishna conscious community over there. So in this way we can have all the aspirations but for the satisfaction of Krishna. And obviously you will enjoy no, you also live on the same island so you can enjoy. But if you think let me have everything and enjoy myself enjoyment will never happen. This is very simple science in which we are related to Krishna. We are prakriti and Krishna is the eternal purusha. The enjoyer ishvara so simply this mentality has to be changed. So we plan my happiness, my happiness let us plan Krishna's happiness and then you see in that proportion happiness is increasing in our life. And now Lord Krishna is telling in this verse that you are Shetra Gyna. You are not the controller, you are nor of the field. Krishna is controlling and making the body act as per your desires. But Krishna tells shetra gyam chapimam with the sarvakshetreshubharata. Although Krishna has completely debunked the impersonal process and tells it is not at all recommended. It takes a very very long time and it is very troublesome, full of miseries. This path is the path of Impersonalism. Still this Loka is giving even more direct evidence. So Krishna has told you are a knower of the field. But in this verse Krishna tells cha means and shetragya Chapi mam with the Mam means me. You should understand I am also the knower of all bodies. You are the knower of your body. But what is the difference? I am also shetragya. I am different kind of a different kind of knower of fields. Sarvakshetreshubharata, I am noor of all the bodies of all the fields. Thus we are called Paramatma, we are called Atma. And God is present as Paramatma means the super soul soul of all the bodies. Paramatma is conscious of all the bodies. We are conscious of just this body which we have got now in this life. So very clearly Krishna mentions there are two gyas, two noirs of the field. So Cha means and and means plural. There is distinction. So such theories which tell I am only God, I am only Parmatma. Such theories are never approved by Krishna. Krishna tells you should know that I am also Shetragya but I am Sarva shetra, shetragya I am knower of all the fields. And then Krishna mentions to understand this body and its owner is called knowledge. That is my opinion. So we have to have factual knowledge of this body and then the owner of this body if we understand these things, that is knowledge. The Lord says I am the owner of the field of activities in every individual body. The individual may be the knower of his own body but he is not in knowledge of other bodies. The supreme Personality of Goddess who is present as the super soul in all bodies knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all various species of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. So very nice comparison is given. Just like kings are there, king is there and subjects are there subjects know their own field but king knows all the properties and fields of the kingdom. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom and the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Anytime the king wants or the government wants they may take over land or property of anybody. In a similar fashion we are secondary proprietors and Krishna is primary proprietor. Whenever Krishna wants we have to leave this body or one limb of the body will not work. Paralysis happens or entire body coma happens. So thus Krishna is the prime proprietor and we are the secondary proprietors. So thus very clearly it is mentioned in this loca that there are two souls Parmatma and Atma within the body. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of body, the constitution of the individual soul and the constitution of super soul is known in terms of Vedic literature as Gyanam. So perfect knowledge of these three things Kshetra and two Gyan, their relationship, that is called knowledge. Then if a person knows perfect knowledge of these things, then the soul would be very very happy always. So we should understand that we are also Prakriti. This is perfect knowledge about ourselves. We are different from body. Now people think shetra GNA are one. Only I am this body. So thus the Vedic literatures don't explain this thing directly. First of all, the living entities engage gradually in the pious activities. An impious man or woman cannot understand. So a pious person, when the intelligence is purified by little contemplation, just like a child, if it wants to contemplate, what are these governance mechanisms? How the government maintain the finances, what is currency, trade and everything it will not be able to understand. Child needs to grow in a similar fashion. When we grow in our consciousness, then with contemplation I can understand. If I ask who am I? Am I the finger of the body? Am I blood in the body? Am I bones in the body? Am I the eyes, am I the liver? And I say no, I'm not none of these things. I am the knower of all these things. It is my body, my organs, my bones, my fingers, my limbs. So I am knower of this body. I am different from this body. So this is first step. I am living in this body. I will continue to next body. And another Parmatma, my constant companion is directing me through all these different bodies. So knowledge of Prakriti which is forming so many Kshetras and the two knowers of the field that is called knowledge. Now lord Krishna explains to Arjuna tatsram yachayadriksha yadvikariyatashayat sachayo yatrabhavasha Tatsama sena meshrino. Now please hear my brief description of this field of activity and how it is constituted, what its changes are, whence it is produced, who that knower of field of activities is and what his influences are. So now Krishna will describe what is this kshetra, what constitutes this kshetra as it is knowledge Krishna would be giving and what are its changes when it is produced. Who is the nor of the field of activities and what are the influences. One has to know how this body is constituted, the materials of which this body is made, under whose control this body is working, how the changes are taking place. Just see. Very nice analysis is given here. When as to know how this body is constituted, the materials of which the body is made, under whose control the body is working. I know somebody has made the body and somebody's controlling all the affairs of the body. And such nice intelligent system. It is what we are trying to make. Now. Artificial intelligence that is there present in the body. Every cell is intelligent, every cell is a city, generates power, maintains traffic and it has walls, it has security, and everything is so nice. So within every cell there is intelligence, there is temperature regulation, there are neural networks within the body, there are chemical networks within the body, and there are so many systems within the body. So somebody has created all these wonderful systems mechanisms. So who is that controller? It is important to understand how the changes are taking place. Because some changes are pleasant, some are unpleasant. So if I can understand how the changes are taking place, I can then try to leverage good changes for my benefit. Where from the changes are coming, what the causes are, what the reasons are, what the ultimate goal of the individual is, and what the actual form of the individual soul is. So everything has got a purpose. If somebody has made a fan that has got a purpose, if somebody has manufactured a typewriter that has got a purpose, similarly this body has been manufactured, there should be a purpose. And living entity does not even think what is the purpose, who has made it then that is animal mentality. Any machine we see, we immediately ask what is the purpose? Why you have made this machine? So why all these so many machines are happening? Such complex system is going on. So one has to ask all these questions. So now Lord Krishna is going to describe all these things very nicely and how Lord Krishna is telling that you can get perfect knowledge of all these activities. Rishivir bahuda GITAM chando vir vive Pratak brahma sutra padai shaiva hetu madhvir Vinish chita. So it is very important to have knowledge of all these activities, because we suffer because of this mind and body. Death is happening because of this body and diseases are happening in this body. Old age happens in this body, stress happens in the mind. So one has to have knowledge of this mind and body system. So how to have this knowledge? So in Vedic times also people were pondering about this, just like now also people have an atheistic theory and they explain evolution, Darwinism and so many other things for evolution of these wonderful forms that we see around us. So in Vedic times also various philosophies were there. And who can explain such philosophies? Ordinary person will not have brains. Rishihir bahuda GITAM krishna explains the knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities is described by various sages in various Vedic writings. But Lord Krishna tells those are not authorized. Chando BIR vividhai Pratak. So rishi means a person who is very intelligent, very advanced. So this Vedic knowledge, knowledge of Bhagavad gita, it is meant for the rishis. Thus Krishna tells, in fourth chapter of Bhagavad gita Imam Rajarashayo viduhu, krishna spoke to Manu Vivaswan and he spoke to Ikshawaku avam parampra praptam Imam rajarashayo viduhu. So only rishis can understand. Rishi means very, very exalted topmost personalities. So they are the great sages brahmanas and some kings, they were called Raj Rishis. But the point is, as it is mentioned in Mahabharat king Yuzhar mentions, if you have to understand truth, then Rishis also will not be able to help. Tarko pratishta shritayo Vibhana NASA Rishir yasimatam Nabhanam. By logic you cannot understand what is truth. Because there are various logicians. One person who is very expert in giving logic, just like we see in court of law, person who is very good advocate, may be able to defeat a person who is on the side of righteousness, but he is poor in logics and arguments. So by logics and arguments you cannot establish truth. A strong logician can defeat a weaker logician. Even though he may be on the side of truth, then people of knowledge Rishis, should we approach them? So it is told NASA Rishir Yasimatam Nabhennam so he is not called a Rishi whose opinion is not unique or not different from the other Rishis. Just like philosophers have various philosophies, if you speak the same thing, why people would come to you. Thus people write my gita, my own Bhagavad gita, my interpretation. If you repeat the same thing why people should hear from you. They think so. Let me write something unique. Let me create chemistry out of Bhagavad gita. Or let me explain history out of Bhagavad Gita. Let me explain psychology out of Bhagavad or XYZ. Let me explain business out of Bhagavad gita and so many other things they explain in their own way. So this is called Rishi. So Rishi, Munis, they have their own opinions. So you go to hundred Rishis, all of them will have different opinions. So from Rishi also perfect knowledge cannot be taken, because Bahudagitam Krishna is telling. It is described by various sages in various Vedic writings. Chando ber vivedhai pritak. So there are so many varieties of philosophies given by the Rishis like Gautam, Kannad, Kapila, and there were six main philosophies which explain the Vedic knowledge only. But in their own interpretation, somebody explaining Nirvisheshwad, somebody Savisheshwad. And in this way so many philosophies are there. But we should understand from Lord Krishna, which is a perfect philosophy. And that so that Bhagavad gita is so beautiful, just see very clearly, it is written here brahmasutra Padaish Chaiwa hetu Madhvirvinish Chita. So the perfect knowledge of all those Rishis should be understood from Brahmasutra padaish Chaiva, brahma Sutra. Brahmasutra means vedanta sutra. That is given by vedivya. So this philosophy is perfect. So Vaisheshika is rejected and Nirvisheshwad is rejected, yoga is rejected and Sankhya is rejected, but Brahma Sutra is accepted. So among the six philosophies which explain the Vedic knowledge also the perfect philosophy Lord Krishna tells is Brahma Sutra. So how you will analyze what is Prakriti, what is Purush, who is controller? Somebody explains that Prakriti is eternal. Somebody will tell the GNA is eternal. And there is only one Atma Parmatma or one. And somebody will explain something else like. This people have different opinions about nature and the controller of this nature and the living entities. Somebody is telling this nature does not exist, it is only illusion. So like this so many philosophies are there. But the perfect philosophy is the Vedanta philosophy. Vedanta Sutra or Brahmasutra philosophy given by Maharshi Vedavyas brahma Sutra padaish Chaiva hetu madhvir Vanesh Chattaya that knowledge of the field of activities and of the knower of activities described by various sages in various Vedic writings, especially in the Vedanta Sutra, and is presented with all reasoning as to cause and effect. And how do we understand this Vedanta Sutra? That is explained in Shrimad Bhagavatam Bhashyam brahmasutranam. So Krishna is explained very nicely here that you read Brahma Sutra. And Brahma Sutras are very difficult to understand. Anavriti shabdat janmadiya sayataha tato brahma jigyasa. So that needs also very intelligent mind to understand. Thus, Vedvyas was dissatisfied even after composing the brahma sutras. Then under guidance of Narad Muni, he explained very explicitly so that there is no cause of wrong interpretation. Then Srimad Bhagavatam came out and it is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam and in other scriptures it is mentioned about Srimad Bhagavatam, that this is Bhashyam Brahmasutranam. This is commentary on the vedanta sutra. On the brahma sutra. So thus Lord Krishna is telling Arjuna to read Srimad Bhagavatam here from this verse brahma Sutra padaish Chaiva hetu madhvir Vinish chatai so very nicely cause and effect are analyzed now also we are analyzing cause and effect now we are having some cough, some cold, we analyze. It is not because of some normal virus, it is because of other virus that is called COVID. What is the cause of COVID Then they tell something came from Wuhan or some other place. They are trying to analyze the cause. Unless you understand the cause of miseries, you cannot solve the problem, you cannot solve the misery. So thus Krishna is telling this scientific understanding is very good cause and effect analysis. But the perfect cause and effect analysis is mentioned in the Brahma Sutra. All other cause and effect analysis are imperfect. For example, if somebody asks that I need to go to Delhi from Mumbai, where do I go? What is the fastest means of reaching? Oh, I know. Yeah. If you reach that place, people go to the Santa Cruz. There there is something called airport. And those people who go to airport and within 2 hours they are able to reach Delhi. Now somebody thinks wow, this is wonderful knowledge. And he goes and sits in the airport hoping that in 2 hours I'll automatically reach Delhi. No. So yes, going to airport, that is right. But at airport what happens? You have to board a flight and then flight will take you to Delhi. In a similar fashion, people are able to understand that sarvam kalvidam Brahma there is Brahma everywhere. There is one energy which is called Brahma, which is spread everywhere and that is a cause of all varieties that we see here. That is a fact. But there is cause of that Brahma Jyoti also and Krishna tells in Bhagavad gita Brahmanohi Prathashtaham I am the source of that Brahma jyoti so just like somebody who reached airport, he's very fortunate. And there would be so many people guiding you to airport if you want to reach another city. But the perfect knowledge is to understand what happens at the airport that you have to board a flight in a similar fashion we have to understand if a person just advances very much all the vedas will guide you towards this Brahma level. Brahma Bhuta Prasan Natma Nashvochatina Kangshati but if you think this Brahma realization I am not the body, I am consciousness. There is ultimate perfection of spiritual life then that is greatest disaster of our life. Just like a person sitting on the airport could not board a flight, that is disaster. Better he would have sat at home only. Why so much endeavor? So a person who reaches Brahmajyoti but he is not able to understand source of Brahmajyoti, the personality of God such a living entity is called most unfortunate. So thus we should not succumb to any other philosophies which may take us to Brahmajyoti or may take us to Parmatma. But those philosophies which do not take us to ultimate source of even Parmatma and Brahmajyoti all such philosophies are imperfect. And thus we should take help of Brahmasutra. Brahma sutra padaish Chaiva Haitu madhvir vinishchatai. But who can understand Brahmasutra? Rishis can understand. Rishis have described and Rishi only can understand. So Bhagavad Gita is actually not meant for vedas are not meant for ordinary people. It is meant for the dwijas twice born. And for those who are less intelligent, supplementaries are given Purana. Purana means very old history. Purana also means supplementary which completes something so ordinary people cannot understand. That is why Puranas are given. But even to understand that we have to have these qualifications. So these are not something which is transferred in family tradition. I am Brahman. My son is Brahman. No, just like engineer son can become engineer if he goes to engineering college and picks up an engineering job in a similar fashion we have to qualify ourselves to become Brahmana or shakriya like that Raj Rishi then we will be able to understand. Unless we become Brahmana, we will not be able to understand this Brahma Jnan so thus Srila Prabhupada explains understanding of philosophy is very nice. But more important than understanding philosophy is practical application of philosophy. Thus Prabhupada explains unless somebody gets up early in the morning there is no question of spiritual life. Spiritual life has not begun. So we have to get up early in the morning. Ideally by 04:00 we all should get up in the morning. And then after getting in the morning there should be morning sadhana. There should be chanting every day. And then there should be seva practical devotional service save on Mukhai jivvada and like this as Bhagavad gita guides practically we should engage in service of Krishna. And then we will be able to have Brahmanical qualities. Which are those qualities satyam we will be very truthful shama dhamma we will be perfectly controlling our senses. Senses will not be able to drag us. So if senses are dragging us too much, we should try to control take the guidance of devotees. Our mind should be in our control shama dhamma and we should be titikshava very very tolerant. I should not get disturbed very easily. Somebody spoke few words I got disturbed. Somebody criticized, I got disturbed. Rather, devotee is not disturbed in any circumstances. Devotee is always satisfied. So devotee should be very very tolerant. Shanti devotee should be very very peaceful. Arjavam devotee should be very very simple. So like this so many qualifications are required. So when we acquire all these qualifications of a Brahmana then we will be able to understand Bhagavad Gita and other scriptures by reading Brahma Sutras. So thus Lord Krishna has given the brief intro that what is knowledge? And there are basically three things which we have to understand to have knowledge prakriti purusha and ishvara and how to get this knowledge we have to have qualification. We have to become a sage rishi and how do we accomplish it after getting these qualifications? Brahma Sutra padai Shiva by reading Vedanta sutra or the commentary on Vedanta Sutra Shrimad Bhagavatam in this way we can attain perfect knowledge in the life. And how Lord Krishna summarizes the details are explained in Srimad Bhagavatam but Brahma Sutra pada Chaiva sama sena lord Krishna mentions in brief summary I'll be now explaining to you so how Lord Krishna summarizes this knowledge. Very very important knowledge. Do not miss the next session. So any person who has knowledge of these elements will exhibit certain features. Just like a person who is dull, you can understand this person is dull. He is making some mistakes. A person who is having COVID, they are displaying some symptoms. In a similar fashion, a person who is having knowledge what Lord Krishna describes here also exhibits certain symptoms. And let us see analyze how many symptoms, terms and to what degree they are present within us. So all these wonderful things we'll understand in the next class."
