The transcendentalists. There are materialists and transcendentalists karmis people who work very hard so that they enjoy the result of activity. They are called materialist. And transcendentalists means they have got nothing to do with this material world. So they are classified as Gyanis, Yogis and Bhaktas. So among these transcendentalists only Bhakta devotee can understand the science. And what happens when he understands this science? Madhavayo papadyate madhava upapadhyate means attains. He attains my nature. So everyone is having certain nature. Some people are good, some people are bad. Some people are very generous. Some people are very miserly. We all have various natures in this material world. And the nature that we exhibit depends upon our body. That is not our true nature. We are forced to exhibit certain nature. The living entity acquires the body of a dog. Forced to acquire dog's nature acquires the body of snake. Forced to behave like snake. So we behave with great envy. We behave with great affection. All this happens under the control of material nature. But living entity has got its original nature also. And in our original nature, spiritual nature we are full of all the divine qualities. The living entity is very very loving, compassionate, kind, generous. And all these wonderful features are there which we can understand from the example of the great devotees who come here and display those symptoms. And even when God personally comes here god shows by his example how humble he is. So one Brahmana is going and kicking grigomuni God on the chest. And what is God's response? He is God's supreme Personality. He can kill that person immediately. He can put that person in unlimited torture. Just imagine if we were the kings of the world. Anybody dare come and speak a word to us. He would be met with very strict punishment. But here is God who is controller of everything, all the worlds. Infinite supreme soul. An infinitesimal, insignificant, ignorant atomic soul that to conditioned in this material universe. Already such a living entity is in jail. The liberated living entities. 90% of the living entities are located in the spiritual atmosphere. So what to speak of a gentleman? So people who are there in this material universe they are not gentlemen. But such a person approaches Krishna and kicks Krishna Lord Narayan on his chest. And rather than showing any anger Lord Narayan starts massaging his feet. But I'm sorry, I could not pay attention. You are a great brahmana. You came here, your foot might have got hurt. So just see the humility of God. And if everyone gets all these qualities then world is so nice. So actually the world is nice. Just like in jail. People keep on beating, fighting with each other many times. Because people of crooked mentalities are there. So in a similar fashion material world there is lot of trouble by other living entities. Because we cannot show all these absolute qualities. But a person who understands the science he can acquire such qualities. And apart from these qualities Krishna's body also has got a different nature which is different from the nature bodies have here. Here the bodies get fatigued, get tired. They are influenced by the whips of material nature in the form of hunger, thirst and all such problems. But spiritual body is not affected by such things. So Krishna tells one who understands this science he can attain body of my nature. Krishna's body is eternal. Full of all knowledge, full of bliss, full of enjoyment. So is it so simple? If a person simply understands the science then he'll be able to attain a body which is eternal body which is having spiritual nature like that of Krishna. Is it so simple? Yes, it is that simple. But what does it mean? That understanding the science. So understanding the science means scientifically. We have to understand the knowledge of God. So what is called scientific understanding. That is why Gyan and vign two words are used. Gyan means theoretical knowledge and Vikyan means scientific knowledge and practical knowledge. Science means you should have some theory and then you should be able to show it, do it practically. That is called science. If you cannot put it into practical application then that is not actual science. That is some pseudoscience or some story. Science means practical application is required. So that is called vijnanam. Vijnanam is scientific understanding. It is also known as practical understanding. So that is called real understanding of the subject matter. If you really understand how the electricity flows then you should be able to make electricity flow in my house. Otherwise you do not know exactly how to do it. If you really know how this nuclear energy works you should be able to leverage nuclear energy. That means you are actually a nuclear scientist. Otherwise you are a novice. So those who are advanced in sciences are able to put sciences into practical use. Otherwise novice. So a person who understands the science of God very nicely means he is able to put this into practical use then such a person when so that is why Prabhupada told more important than philosophy is practical application of philosophy. So that is why whatever we are reading in Bhagavad Gita it should reflect in our practical lives. If our life is same, we were doing the same things. What we were doing before reading Bhagavad Gita it means we are still novice in our understanding. So we should not get discouraged. We should keep on hearing. Simply by hearing and acting under direction of devotees we will be able to practically apply these things. We all begin with novice stage. But then we are expected that we start applying all these things in our life. That is called ETA Vigyaya. Knowing this scientifically perfectly. And when we know this perfectly then our body is different. We don't get this body full of suffering. Now let us see next what Lord Krishna has to answer. Lord Krishna is answering some of the biggest questions which have been confusing all the topmost scientists. And that is the origin of the world and origin of consciousness. So many theories, people are not understanding whether this matter is eternal as people were thinking before that this matter is eternal. Material world is eternal. And that is what is mentioned in Buddhist philosophy. And then they told no, no matter is not eternal. Matter has come from point. They are calling singularity. They do not know what is this actually singularity. How singularity exploded into such a big systematic universe. And what was before singularity? They tell oscillating universe. Just like the pendulum oscillates. Because there should be some force. So how this external force acted, created they told no external force like oscillation. It is going on either side. So like this so many theories are there about this matter. From where this matter? Why this matter exists at all? Is it eternal? Was it always existing? These balls were floating in there always. The sun, moon waters were there always. And then they analyzed no actually it is accelerating. So it should have been point size at some time. It would have been zero size at some time. Like this they are trying to conjecture something. What is the source of this matter. And then matter they are able to understand something. But consciousness there is no understanding. So what is the source of consciousness? How does it stay in the body? What are the laws which act upon consciousness? Very consciousness is function of what? What is function of consciousness? Very difficult to understand. So that Lord Krishna answers very nicely in this shloka. And what is that text number 20? Prakritim Purusham Chaiva Vidhanadiyubhavapi, Vikara Shaguna Chaiva, vidhi prakriti sambhavan Swarjuna had asked Prakriti Purush Shetra, Shaitragya Ganam and Gayam So the four topics have been explained by Krishna. Krishna explained what is Shetra field of activities? Who is the knower of the field shetragya? There are two knowers atma and Parmatma. What is Gyna knowledge and what is Gayam? What is to be known? What is knowable? What is gyana gammyam? These things Krishna has explained. Now the first two subject matters prakriti and Purush. The nature and the enjoyer that Lord Krishna is answering here now. Prakritim purusham Chaiva vidhi anadhyu bhavapi. So Lord Krishna is telling here. Very clear answer. So we should not try to understand using our body which is an imperfect instrument. If you have a weighing scale and that is defective whatever you measure out of it you can never rely upon it. That may not be perfect measurement weight of the object thermometer which is faulty. You cannot depend upon it to measure the temperature. So that is why we have to understand this body is also faulty. As you would have seen most of you in Mantra, Yoga or Jagyasa workshop that our senses are having four defects. Karna, pata, Pramad brahm, viprilipsa. We all commit mistakes. We can never be sure. Thus, whether what I'm perceiving is right or not, senses have got limitations. We come under illusion, mistake mirage for water. So when this body which is full of defects we are using this body to understand knowledge that is foolishness. We should not use a faulty instrument thermometer or weighing scale to have perfect knowledge. Thus this body will not be able to give perfect knowledge. We can never be sure of the outcome. And any instruments which we want to use in our research because those instruments are produced by this body which itself is imperfect, those instruments also are imperfect. It is very simple to understand. Imperfect instrument can create another imperfect instrument. So we have to take knowledge from there is only one source god, the Supreme Creator. Then everything becomes very easy. And what is God telling about the reality of this world? Nature and the living entity? Krishna explains prakritim purusham Jaiva vidhi you please Vidhi, you must know it is anadi. Material nature and living entities should be understood to be beginning less. Now this is very important. This one verse itself. These two lines are so important. Material nature and the living entities are beginning less. Oh, I thought I took birth some 15, 2030, 40, 60, 70 years ago from the womb of my mother. Before that I was not existing. But Lord Krishna, the topmost authority and all the authorities of knowledge from the Eastern philosophers, acharyas to the Western scientists, they all have been great readers, followers of Bhagavad Gita as we have seen in our sessions. And what is the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita? The topmost science? It is mentioned vidhi anadi ubha API ubha means both. So matter is also eternal and do not think matter develops. And then at some point of time matter exhibits consciousness. Just like the milk after some transformation exhibits some bacteria. Now the consciousness is eternal. Purusham, the living entity is eternal and so is prakriti. So this fact itself is so revealing. Material nature was always existing. And I also have always been existing. Along with material nature we are eternal. So it means before this body I would have taken another body, before that another body. So how this transformation is happening that we see around us? Material nature is changing. Our bodies are changing. We are getting old. We are getting again new body. Vikara gunash Chaiva vidhi prakriti Samhavan their transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature. This science has understood. So when the priests were quoting Bible and other things, god told let there be creation. And creation happened. They found it unscientific and they told see, we have figured out there is DNA, there is X chromosome, Y chromosome. Nature works in this way and produces whatever we see around us. The effects, the rainbow you are telling it is some heavenly effect. But no, we see the rainfall. You are telling it is caused by indra. But we see now it is condensation that prior to that is evaporation and then there is wind, current and so many other things. So they told it is happening scientifically under the control of nature. Lord Krishna is telling here the same thing. The transformations and the modes of matter are products of material nature. It is a fact. Material nature only is doing all these things. What is happening around us? The body, birth of body, development of body, old age everything is happening. They are right. There are DNA strands. They start getting disfigured and then eventually thus there is old age. All these things are fine. That is perfect. There are codes sitting in our DNAs and basis. Those codes, our bodies functioning, our behavior and everything is defined as per that. But prakriti is not independent. This is what they don't understand. Mother supplies body to the child. That is a fact. Each and every organ is supplied by the mother. But mother alone cannot produce a child. Father through his semen gives the soul to the mother's womb and mother provides the body. So in a similar fashion material nature is not independent in the activities of providing bodies to us and producing the transformations around us. So there is no conflict. Krishna is telling. Yes, Vidhi. Prakriti. Sambhavan, all the transformations are done by prakriti. But Prakriti krishna tells Maya adhyakshayana prati suyatesa Characharam krishna is telling Prakriti sambhavan, everything is happening by Prakriti. But whose direction Prakriti is following? Maya Adhyakshayana, Prakriti prakriti is following my direction. It is not happening by chance. Now 1 may question that why material nature is showing these transformations in such a ruthless manner killing me life after life I am eternal. Why nature does not give me a body which is good which can sustain always, which does not die in which there are no diseases? Why so much harassment? Material nature is bringing for me? Why so much pain and suffering? So next Shloka is very very revealing again so this Shloka also we should understand so simply if we understand from the God there is no need of research work which anyway is not a perfect work. Because our body is defective, mind is defective, we are bound to commit mistakes. So if we take instructions of Krishna we save time from all such research. So research also will lead us to perfect conclusion. After many many lives Krishna is seated in the heart. He will guide. But to save time we should take help of the Shastras. Maybe you can figure out how the machine is working nicely after spoiling a dozen of machines so after spoiling dozen of not dozen, millions of bodies human intelligent bodies a person may be able to figure out how everything is happening. But to save time, why to suffer for millions of lives we should take direct instruction from user manual krishna himself and Krishna is telling you are eternal so just like now you have some friends. You have society like this you have had for many many lives before. With the anadi there is no beginning. So now from the beginning why am I suffering? Why material nature is behaving in such a tormenting way? So Lord Krishna answers that in the next verse. And what is that? Karikarana karthritv prakate purusha sukhadu kanam bhoktrith. Now Lord Krishna, this is also very very important. He mentions Kari Karan Kartrith. Kariya means effect. Karan means cause. Nature is said to be the cause of all material activities and effects. But very important. Whereas the living entity is the cause of various sufferings and enjoyments in this world. So definitely material nature is creating all the effects and the causes of those effects. Material nature will create heat. Material nature will create crowds. Material nature will create rainfall. Material nature will create grains. Material nature creates hunger. And a man eats the grains. And then the soul which has fallen, it enters into the semen of the man. And then through it the nature pushes it in the womb of the mother. And then nature provides us body. And then the body comes out. Body develops, body produces byproducts again body dwindles vanishes. And so many things. Somebody will come and curse us. Somebody will come and gift us something. Somebody will come and kill us. Somebody will come and do so many, somebody can come and do many favors to us. So all these things changes that we have in the world around us are the creations of material nature. But the happiness and distress is not the creation of material nature. Happiness and distress happens because of the living entity. Living entity is the cause of various sufferings and enjoyments in this world. So nature will produce its effect. But whether we are going to suffer or not depends upon us. So this is very enlightening and empowering realization. So I should not think I am suffering because of something or somebody either. Some systems are not good. So if I correct the systems I will be happy. And thus people have dedicated their lives. There have been many, many movements. There has been French revolution, Bolsheviks and so many things. Communists and freedom movements. And all these movements, they thought if we change the system people would become very happy. Systems have changed. There have been so many campaigns, so many elections, so many governments have come and gone. So many five year terms they have fulfilled so many planning commissions to make people happy. And what is the result of many many decades of planning? Even in the best of the countries that people have become more and more depressed. Wow, what an endeavor it is. The best of the brains are put into planning commission. And they are given all the resources and support of the king or the government. And the result of that planning is instead of becoming happy people have become more and more distressed what is this happening. If I plan for happiness 100 units at least five units I should attain. I am planning for happiness. 100 units. And I am getting -200 so thus Lord Krishna is telling here. You cannot change the nature. We think by changing the nature externally person will be made happy. If I bring so many objects of sense enjoyment. That is what the westerners thought. Oh. Now our country is very advanced and we have resources. So as a children we could not enjoy. We were aspiring for so many things. Our parents could not provide. Let us provide our children with everything. And they did that. And the result was children started becoming depressed. So it is a great foolishness. Greatest foolishness. So I was speaking to a person who is very very successful. And he is pass out from one of the top four old IITs of the country. And he works in a company where he was working then. Now he has changed in a company where all India rank 110 15 they join. And then he's sending his children to the best school of Mumbai and then he's telling prabhu what to do. There is dissatisfaction in life. I'm not able to satisfy my children. Now externally he has done all the good arrangement. The best school of the country or the best school of the city where all the successful or so called famous people they send their children to. He is doing that. But the children are not satisfied. So actually we need to shake up and wake up. We don't take help of this knowledge. So how much ever you try to change the nature around you try to change the people around you try to change the resources around yourself. But we are not going to become happy. Happiness and distress is not because of nature. So stop trying to dominate over material nature. Lord Krishna is telling we should not have connection with material nature at all. We should become independent of material nature. So the story of moth we have discussed many times. The same story is there in our lives also. There is no difference at all. The moth because of its attraction towards fire loses its life. Similarly we because of our attraction towards this material nature we lose our life. Our death is happening only because we are attracted to material nature. We think, oh, this city is very good. If I go and travel and live in this city, this is very nice, I will become happy. This beach house or house in the mountains is very good. Let me live in these beautiful valleys. Oh, this person, he or she is very good if they can become my spouse. So all these things we keep on planning. But this does not bring happiness to us. Because of this thing only we are dying life after life because of attraction to material nature. Towards material nature. So that is why Lord Krishna tells always remain equipoise. Sama, Sukeshu, Dukeshu, Tata, Mana, Pamanayo remain equipoise in honor and dishonor. Honor and dishonor are great deceptions created by the material nature. Living entities cheated by this honor and dishonor. And because just like a moth gets attracted towards fire, loses life, we by getting attracted with these material features lose our life and keep on taking more bodies life after life. So we have to understand no amount of external arrangement will be able to satisfy us. This we have seen in the society in our life. But still become under illusion. Because this illusion is created by God. Unless we take God's help by our own intelligence, we cannot come out of it. God has created this illusion. That is why the Acharyas pray. This illusion is so great. How can I come out? No, I have one hope. Because tomar Acha, by your desire living entity has got trapped in this illusion. So if you so desire, the living entity can come out. This is what Prabhupada wrote. So thus by getting attracted to material nature trying to dominate over material nature this is the disease of the living entity. And the more we are attracted towards material nature the hard is the struggle for this life existence. So our happiness and distress is never because of the material nature. It is only because of us. The government has created systems. The government has created residences, facilities and everything. And all the changes in the state will happen as per the direction of government. Now whether those changes so I'm explaining how to understand what Lord Krishna has mentioned here. So those changes which government has introduced will bring happiness to us or distress, it depends upon us. So material nature is like government acting under direction of Krishna supreme King controller. Now whether because of those changes we'll be happy or we'll feel distress, it depends upon us. Government has created very good houses for government servants. You can live in presidential house. If you become president or if you become minister, you will have various good facilities or if you become a rogue, that is your choice. Then government has created a prison house also. Government has created police department also. But it is not that everyone would be beaten by the police department. So in a similar fashion, the nature is acting under direction of Krishna. But whether we will enjoy or not depends. Whether we are obedient to Krishna or not. Whether we are abiding by the laws of nature or not. So thus it is very very simple, purusha Sukhadukhanam. So nature is not punishing us. We are getting punished because of our deeds, because of ignorance. So what we need to understand is we should stop trying to dominate over this material nature and understand this very important next verse. What is that? Purusha prakaratistohi bhunte prakriti jan gunan karanam guna sangoasya sadh sadyoni janmasu purusha prakaratistohi the living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life enjoying the three modes of nature So what we are enjoying is not actually reality. We are spirit souls. Our enjoyment is enjoying spiritual reality. But this is illusory enjoyment. Imitation enjoyment is given to us. Just like we may drink a natural lemonade or we can drink some chemical imitation of lemonade also taste may be the same but one is produced by chemical and one is natural. One is harmful for us. One enjoyment, another natural thing is good for our health. In a similar fashion, spiritual enjoyment is very good for us. But material enjoyment harmful. Old death, disease happens life after life. So what we are enjoying here is not substance but imitation of the substance. Spirit is actual substance. And this matter is simply imitation that we see around us. We have a so called real life. We have a virtual life also that is created by some coders. So a person can enjoy this life or that life in a similar fashion. This entire material life is a virtual life. So we are enjoying the three modes of nature. Living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life. Enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good evil among various species. Sadh asad yoni. Janmasu yoni means birth. Sadh means good. Asad means bad. Sadh also means eternal. Assad means temporary. In this context, it means good and bad. So whether the birth is good, you are born opulent, you are born strong, healthy, very wise or you are born very dumb, deaf, dull. It depends upon what modes we are associating with urduga chanti Satvasta madhya Tish chantirajasa Jagan so here we can cheat the system outside we can write some exams and show that I'm a good man. In interview I can speak. I want to become civil servant because I want to serve the people and I will not reveal. I want a good life partner. And this is my desire to show my society I become successful and all these things I have a desire to control people, to hold power. This I may not reveal. And then I may end up being a corrupt officer. But this cannot happen in Krishna's government. Satva when a person is having Satvic qualities he is associating with Sathwic nature. Satva is one quality, one energy. Satva Rajasthamas these three energies produce everything around us. So if we associate with Satvic nature, we'll be promoted higher and we will get more freedom and more facilities in this material world. And those in mode of passion, they stay on these middle planets, earthly planets. And those who are Adoga chanti tamasa associated with mode of ignorance they are put into hellish situations of life. So as per the situation of the heart in which mode we are situated we will either get promoted, we will continue the same existence or we would be demoted in this way we have reincarnation or transmigration happens basis the modes of nature we associate with. So if we have satvic lifestyle, we are associating with satvoguna satvic people, then we can go to higher planets. If you are very very satvic person has followed Gnashic Brahmacharya Sanyas, he can go to topmost planet Brahmaloka Mahar Lok Janalok Tapalok Satya Lok if a person has followed up to vanaprastha, they can go to one level below that. Those who have remained only Brahmacharya one level below that. So like this top four planetary systems are there. They are beyond the jurisdiction of repeated annihilation. Even though all the lower planetary systems are destroyed in the nighttime of Brahma, those four planets continue. So nature will not disturb. Because those four planets are only for spiritual cultivation. And even when the demons go and attack sometimes higher planets there are various species of life. We are struggling to go to next planet. But species are very very powerful from the lower planet. They can go to the topmost planet and disturb the devatas. But they cannot go to these top four planets. So if we are very very sadvic, we will have a life of no disturbance at all. There is practically no misery over there. But there is some misery because they feel compassion upon the living entities who are suffering in the lower planets over here who have got stuck. So indirectly they suffer because of compassion. But otherwise if you have satvaguna very high satvaguna, you can get promoted to those planets where there is no repeated destruction. Also where there is no entrance of demonic living entities and very peacefully person can cultivate spiritual life. And when the universe centered universe winds up, then those people can get liberated. But if a satvoguna is little less, then they can become devatas and they can enjoy heavenly opulences. Though there will be little disturbances at time, but they don't suffer like us. Every day some disease and death and uncertainty, all these things are not there. So the more we are satvic, the more we have material enjoyment and tamsik if we become, there would be lot of suffering in our life. So laws of nature we cannot cheat. So in this way the soul is having transmigration reincarnation life after life simply because of association with the various modes. But a person should desire not to associate either with Tamuguna, Rajaguna and satvoguna. Because even if you have a very satvic body you may again fall down from that situation. Because we are still in the material universe only and there is always a chance that we can associate with the lure modes. So thus a living entity should not associate with material nature at all. And how that can happen? Upadrishtanu manta cha bharata Bhokta Maheshwarah Paramat Mehti chapiyukto dehesh min purusha Paraha by understanding that there is another person situated in the heart and he is not at all affected by the situations of. This body. I am also situated in this heart. But I get affected by the changes of the body. But there is another purush who lives in the heart. But he is not at all affected. How is that so? Upadrishta anumantacha bharta Bhukta Maheshwara. Yet in this body there is another transcendental enjoyer. Who is the Lord, the Supreme Proprietor who exists as the overseer and the permitter and who is known as the super soul. So the soul exists in this body atma there is another soul which is called Param atma supreme soul. So thus very clearly Lord Krishna is telling here there are two Atmas in the body. So the situation of first Atma he described Sad Asad Yoni Janmasu that he gets good birth or bad birth and sukhadu dukhanam happiness and distress is enjoyed by the living entities as per his own actions. But there is another living entity who does not take pleasure in material enjoyment because he is transcendental. Enjoy. He enjoys on spiritual platform and is purusha Paraha. Paraha means transcendental. He is not conditioned like us. He does not think that I am this body. He is completely transcendental. And He's Maheshwara, he's supreme proprietor, supreme controller and he's maintainer of all of us. And he's upadresta and Anumanta, he is always overseeing our activities. What this living entity is doing and desiring and all the desires he sanctions. Why does he sanction? He's very patiently waiting let me fulfill all desires that he wants. So that after many many millions of lifetimes after there are 84 lakh kinds of machines created for our enjoyment. Just like for children in the park, there are various, there are slides, there are swings and so many other things are there for their entertainment. In a similar fashion, living entity wants to enjoy the senses in so many unique ways. So many desires it has got so to fulfill those desires of eating, sleeping, mating, defending, so many species have been created. So after traveling through these 8.4 million species in so many planets in different situations, sometimes going and enjoying heavenly pleasures, where life is so long, where there is no very less fatigue and there are minimal diseases or going and living in a very thumbsic atmosphere drinking continuously for many, many years sleeping for a very, very long time and all kinds of enjoyment like bear sleeps continuously for six months, the demons sleep for a very, very long time. So, so many kinds of enjoyments, all the enjoyments are sanctioned so that the living entity after millions of such lifetimes can come to realization. I am not satisfied. So this knowledge is getting accumulated in the heart. Dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction, dissatisfaction. So perpetual dissatisfaction. When it is accumulated in the heart to such an extent that living entity tries to turn his face towards self realization. Then Parmatma starts guiding him towards the knowledge of self, the knowledge of spirituality. Otherwise he simply observes and keeps on sanctioning. Okay, you want this? Take this. You want that? Okay. Take that. So he is Parmatma. So Parmatma is not affected. He is purusha para by happiness and distress of body. Because he is transcendental. So if we also stop taking stop associating with the modes of this material nature then we also will become Paraha. We also will become transcendental. Although we are living within this body. That is called Jeevan mukta sauce. So that is why all the senses should be always kept in contact with Krishna. So tongue comes in contact with the food items. Material food items. Stop doing it. Always bring tongue in contact with the spiritual food item. That is called Prasadam. Tongue wants to speak something. It comes in contact with material sound vibration. Don't do that. Always talk about Krishna or the talks which we are doing. The result of that talk should help me advance in Krishna consciousness. I might have a job. I am a teacher. I have to teach material sciences. But when we use our tongue to speak material sciences we get some result. That result we use in the service of Krishna. Then again that sound vibration is spiritualized. So in this way all the limbs of the body, the thoughts are there in our thoughts. We should always have Krishna. So our mind and all the senses should be kept in constant contact with Krishna. Then there is no scope of interaction with the material energy. Thus the living entity can remain aloof and remain happy even though we are there in this body. So this body will continue as per the laws of nature. Because this body is made up of material nature. And once we leave this body, then there is spiritual body. Because the situation of heart will be completely spiritualized. So Lord is seated in the heart and he's waiting when the living entity will turn his face towards me. So when living entities do not have this knowledge krishna comes and tells this very important fact that please understand, you are eternal. This material nature is eternal. You will keep on suffering eternally unless you turn your face towards me. And thus today is also very special day. Today is Vaman Jayanti as some of you would have known. And fasted also we do fasting on such days. So today we fasted till noon. We did some extra kirtans to satisfy Lord Vaman Dev. And Lord Vaman Dev also came here to show how the living entities can make their life perfect. So rather than accumulation accumulation even if you accumulate the entirety of this material world that ordinary narrowly we cannot do. But there was a one very powerful king. His name was Bali. He was born in the family of demons. So Bali maharaj. He became so powerful that he was able to dislodge Devtas from their planets. And thus he got the control of entire universe. So just imagine, a person has his kingdom as the entire universe. What more a person can want. So all the Devatas became greatly disturbed. So there are many wonderful instances from this that we can understand. So again, unless a person is actually satvic in nature nobody will be able to hold a position which is meant for Sattvic people. And thus whenever Tamsik people they want to take control krishna comes and shows special favor to the Devtas. Devtas are always held by Krishna. So Krishna again in order to help the Devtas he incarnated in the form of another Devata, son of Aditi as Vaman Dev. And he came in the form of a small boy, dwarf Brahmana and Shukracharya, the spiritual master of Bali Maharaj. He told Bali. So he was knowing the laws of nature that to come to this position of controlling the Indra Loka and other things you have to do certain yajnas. You have to qualify yourself. Otherwise laws of nature will not allow you to do that. So he was engaged in doing this Yajna so that he can become qualified. And meanwhile Devata was worried if he becomes actually qualified we'll never be able to go back. So then they prayed and Lord Krishna came to help them. And the part of any spiritual function is giving charity to devotees Brahmanas. And that holds true in Kalyuga also now and Kalyuga of course, we cannot do any other rituals as a matter of duty we can do. But we don't have such Brahmanas who are qualified to produce desired effects of such yajnas and other things. But to make any such rituals or activities successful we can always do three things. And which are those three things? That is Sankirtan and Prasadam distribution to the devotees and to general people and giving charities to Brahmanas devotees. These three things we should do in every function. Whether it is birth, it is death, it is purchase of anything, it is housewarming or any function that we are doing any purification, it is Chudakaram sanskar, it is Namkaran sanskar. Anything that we are doing, we should just do these three things. And that will make anything successful. Even for deity installation these three things are sufficient. So he as a part of king when he was doing Yajna, he's supposed to do sacrifice. Any Brahmana comes and asks anything the king is supposed to give, there is a duty of a king. And the Brahmanas also were gentle. Actually Brahmana will not beg for anything more. Brahmanas also come as a matter of duty. Sometimes when Brahmanas will give gold dishes because the king has to do charity brahmanas came out and they told what we'll do with these gold plates and other items. So they threw it off. And thus because all the Brahmanas were actually Brahmanas satvik they don't want for them gold or a piece of stone. It's all the same part of material nature. They just need to maintain and make their spiritual life perfect. They started throwing it off. It piled up into a mountain of gold. And that is what Lord Krishna guided Arjuna to discover when they wanted some money. And thus Arjuna is called Dhananjaya. So just see this is called Brahman. This is called education. That a person understands this basic science that I am eternal. Material nature is eternal. I should not try to arrange external things around me and think I'll become happy by that. No, simply by surrendering to Krishna I will become happy, nothing else. I should stop dominating over material nature. So Brahmanas were supposed to ask anything and the king is supposed to satisfy Brahmanas. So this small Brahmana comes and then he asks three steps of land. Bali Maharaj told boy, you are a small boy and your intelligence also you don't appear to be very intelligent. I am the master of Universe. If anybody comes to me never in his life there should be chance for him to beg again. So you please ask me some planet, you please ask kingdom just three steps. So then he gave very beautiful instructions. You can read those things in Bhagavatam that a person who is not satisfied by simply keeping his body and soul together he cannot be satisfied by gaining entirety of whatever is available in the material world. So please let me remain satisfied with this thing only. I just need three steps of land. So he told, okay, I will give it to you. But Shukracharya came to know that this is Vishnu. He will steal away everything. Don't give any promise. So Bali Maharaj was actually a devotee at heart because he was grandson of Prahlad Maharaj, another Paramhansa, the greatest authority of spiritual knowledge. And thus he blessed his grandson with devotional service. So in his heart he was devotee although externally he was the ruler of the demons. And he told my dear master, you always told me that this Yajna Yajna my Vishnu is meant for satisfaction of Vishnu. And if this boy is Vishnu and he's asking everything so we should give it, is it not? Because Yajna is only meant for satisfaction of Vishnu. So let us satisfy Vishnu. Vishnu has come here. So this is the tendency of materialist or demons. So they also have to do Yajna. They know that this Yajna is meant to satisfy Vishnu. But they do these activities for one's own benefit. The demons also read the Vedas. So thus it is told in one millennium. So today is Vaman Jayanti. Similarly Lord Krishna comes in the form of Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha is a special purpose of making people atheist that is required time to time. So once some demons were there and using the Vedic knowledge they had created rockets and they were bombing the people everywhere. It is mentioned in Bhagavatam. And thus Lord Buddha came and because they were following Vedas nobody was able to defeat them. Because if you follow the Vedas very nicely you cannot be defeated. Just like Bali maharaj he was able to do these Yajnas and nobody would be able to defeat them if he does it. So Krishna came as Buddha and he made them atheist. They stopped following the Vedas and thus they were defeated. So vedas are user manual. So demons also use the Vedas. So today people are actually tribals, completely ignorant. They do not even know how to use the material resources properly as per the Vedas. So they will satisfy. Do yajna lord Vishnu? So that they can enjoy the resources, the energies of Lord Vishnu. Just like Dhritarashtra and company so Duryodhana also approached Lord Krishna but not for service of Lord Krishna. So that he can enjoy the army of Lord Krishna. So the demons also they will do yajna indirectly. They will approach Lord so that they can enjoy the results the energies of Krishna. Actually they are not interested in satisfying Krishna. So thus it so happens many times that when some devotees they become brahmacharis, their parents come and when they tell you only told us to go to temple and He's Supreme Lord. So Supreme Lord should be followed. We should try to completely satisfy supreme Lord. Now if I want to do that I've done that why you are dissatisfied? So they tell no no little we have to do why you are doing this completely? So not able to understand. So thus this is demonic tendency. Actually I am worshipping Supreme Lord. So that I can extract the energy of supreme Lord. I can enjoy the energy of Lord lord you remain in your place. So thus Shukracharya he taught him everything by Yajna you satisfy Vishnu and then Vishnu will bless you with all the power. But Bali Maharaj was intelligent. He told if Vishnu has to be satisfied, let me satisfy. If he wants to take away everything, let him take. And because Shukracharya objected he rejected the spiritual master then you are not proper spiritual master. And then eventually Lord Vaman Dev he was promised three steps of land in two steps only he covered everything of this material universe. Now third step he asked Bali you told you will give me three steps, where should I keep my third step? So he told there are two things in existence property and proprietor. So now you have taken property, now you please take proprietor also. You please place your third step on my head. And thus he offered himself also. And Krishna became so satisfied by this action of Bali Maharaj that Krishna sold himself to Bali Maharaj. And he told by offering everything to me. Although for temporary for a short while Krishna punished him and he told you have cheated me, you have not given me three steps of land. He was arrested, put in a den just to show what is the situation of devotee. So devotee so much in love. So usually if such thing happens we love a person and the person cheats us. Robs away of our will maybe we'll kill that person. But here we see this is called love. So Krishna after taking away everything if somebody offers this gesture to us he offers all the property and then he offers himself also completely to us. And we arrest that person. So this is very very unjust. But Krishna wanted to show the position of his pure devotee. So Bali Maharaj overcome by ecstasy when he was punished by Krishna he was arrested by Krishna. He told this is a great favor my Lord you have shown to me how this is favor. Actually you are friend of demons. Externally it appears that you favor the demigods. But the demigods when they gain all these material opulences they lose the sight of spiritual life. But from demons, from us you keep on snatching these resources away. So thus we are made to realize the temporary nature of this material world and we develop material detachment. And thus actually you are favoring us by taking away our opulences. So you have done a great favor to us. And in this way in tears of ecstasy he offered respects to Krishna. So thus Krishna shows the exalted position of his devotees. So even though I cheat my devotees I punish my devotees. My devotees are always full of gratitude towards me. And then he released Bali Maharaj. And he told you have purchased me by your charity. You offered everything to me. With great effort you got the control of Indra Loka. But you have offered entire universe to me including yourself. Now I offer myself to you. This one universe you offer to me unlimited universes, innumerable universes are coming out of my body and I am offering Myself to you. I will remain your servant now as your doorkeeper. So Krishna even now today is still standing as the doorkeeper of Bali Maharaj. So just see. So by offering anything to Krishna devotee does not lose anything. And not just that not just spiritual thing not just personal association even materially he gets everything back. So bali Maharaj. He told now indra. He is the current Indra. Now when his tenure is over in next tenure in next Manvantar you will become Indra and Bali Maharaj. Then he told now you please go back to your place of residence your planet. And then now also he told vishwakarma you make his place, his residence more opulent than Indraloka also. So just see unlimited benedictions. Although apparently lost Indra Loka but he told his residence I think that is called suttala his planet. So that should be more opulent than Indraloka. So now also on lower planet he's having much more opulence than Indraloka. And in next Manvantar next millennium he will become Indra again. The post which he relinquished for Krishna and Krishna is standing as his doorkeeper and he is enjoying unlimited spiritual ecstasy. So just see there is no loss at all. So Krishna wants to tell us why you are trying to dominate over material nature, trying to acquire material resources, name, fame, opulence there is only suffering. Don't behave like a moth. Don't die life after life. Just surrender everything unto me. Just maintain yourself and offer everything to me. And in proportion to our surrender to our detachment to this material world gradually and proportionately we will feel spiritual pleasure in our life. The more we surrender to Krishna, the more we detach ourselves from material pleasures. In that proportion we will have spiritual happiness in our life. So thus Lord Krishna tells Ya Evam, Veti, Purusham, Prakritim, Chaguna, Sahas, Sarvata, Vartamano, P, Nasabhuyo, Vijayate one who understands this philosophy concerning material nature, living entity and the interaction of modes of nature is sure to attain liberation. He will not take birth here again regardless of his present position. So if we understand philosophy of material nature, living entity and we understand Parmatma Purusha Para he is Supreme Controller. So if I surrender unto Supreme Controller, life is all perfect and blissful. So then the living entity does not take birth again and suffer in this material nature. So we can choose to come again in this world, in various bodies. But intelligence is to surpass this process of coming over and over again and go beyond all these reincarnations and become eternal associate of Krishna. And that is a perfection of life. So thus on this very auspicious day let us pray to Vaman Dev. What instructions. Wonderful instructions he came and he gave to Bali Maharaj the realizations he gave to Bali Maharaj a fraction of that we also can have in our life. So that we can also follow the footsteps of Bali Maharaj. So Krishna can be served in nine ways and we can make our spiritual life perfect. Shravanam Kiritanam and one such way is Atmanivedanam. If we offer everything, whatever we have to Krishna, including ourselves, then immediately we become spiritually perfect.
