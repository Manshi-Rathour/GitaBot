So arjun is asking very technical questions to Lord Krishna. What is prakriti? What is purush? Because these are the subject matters of discussion of the spiritualists. All the vedas are describing the absolute truth and these terminologies are the center of all discussion. Prakriti, purush, shetra, shetragya, gyanam and gayam. What is prakriti? Prakriti means energy and purush means energetic or the enjoyer. So what is energy? What is energetic? Who is energy? Who is energetic? Energy should follow the dictates of the energetic. What is field? Who is the knower of the field and what is knowledge and what is the end of all knowledge? So Lord Krishna has explained here what is the field. This body is the field. And this body has got knower that is called shetrakya. But there is not just one knower, but two knowers. Krishna tells. Thus anybody who has any doubt about soul being same as super soul, I am only God, as the philosophy says. So that is imperfect because we saw bharata. Lord Krishna has explained know me also as shetragya who is not just the knower of this body, but sarvakshetreshubharata, that special shetragya, he is the knower of all the bodies. So Lord Krishna has explained. Now further, Lord Krishna is giving a crisp description of all these terms. Lord Krishna begins first by describing dakshetra. What is this field actually, just like we have any substance salt. What is salt? Sodium chloride, NA plus CL. So in a similar fashion, when we see this body, what is this body actually? So that Lord Krishna, in brief, he is describing here. But this discussion is very, very important. So it begins with verse number six and seven. Mahabhutany, hankaro Buddhir avyakta mevacha Indriani dashaikamcha pancha Chandria gochar AHA ichadwe shasukamdunadritihi etakshetram samasavikaram udham. The five great elements false ego, intelligence. Then manifested the ten senses, the mind, the five sense objects desire, hatred, happiness, distress, the aggregate, the life, symptoms and convictions. All these are considered in summary, to be the field of activities and its interactions. You. So when we read in our books of science, the world is composed of many elements and those elements are listed in periodic table sodium, potassium, chlorine, iodine, estine, radon. And so many elements are there. We have not seen any one of the element and we may never be able to see it till we live. But we have faith. Anybody describes what constitutes this world, or sodium, potassium, this thing, these are the elements. And then those elements are also combination of electron, protons, neutrons, which we have not seen, but we have faith. And we describe very nicely that yes, this is their electron. It moves like this, they combine together. There is neutron, there is this charge, there is this weight, there is this dimension. So many things we describe, although we have not seen anything, we don't know the weight of atom, we don't know the mass of proton, we don't know the mass of electron. We don't know the velocity, but still we repeat immediately when we are asked, what is the velocity of light three into ten to power 8 meters/second? Immediately we can tell, but we have never measured. So, just like the modern science has come to certain understanding of the world, similarly, the Vedic science also describes the same chemistry how the world is made up of, what the world is made up of, how these elements come together. But the analysis is different. The analysis is not in terms of the elements of periodic table, not in terms of atom, but something which enters even the smallest element, the basic element of this material universe. And which are those elements? They are described here. Mahabhutani. Ahankara, Buddhir avyaktam Avacha. Five great elements earth, air, water, fire and sky. So, just like the scientists describe all these elements of periodic table, the great Sages the scientists of Vedic science, Srila Prabhupada explains from all the authoritative statement of the great sages, the Vedic Hymns and the aphorisms of the Vedanta Sutra, the components of this world are earth, water, fire, air and ether. These are five great elements. Mahabhutani, they are called five great elements. And then three subtle elements are there. False ego is there, mind intelligence is there. And there are ten senses. Which are the ten senses? Five karma Indrias, five gyan Indrias. Gyan indria we call as sense organs. But there are other senses also, as per the Vedic books. And which are those senses? Hands and legs. So these are karma indriyas, by which we perform action. These are also indria. Indria means instrument. So instruments of knowledge and instruments of activity. So five sense organs, they are called instruments of knowledge. Eyes are instruments of knowledge. Ears are instrument of knowledge. Skin is instrument of knowledge. Tongue is instrument of knowledge and nose is instrument of knowledge. And then instruments of action. Arms, legs, they are instruments of action. Holding, grabbing, walking. And there is voice, the vocal cords, instrument of action. And the genitals and anus. So these are five instruments by which we act. So, combined they are all called Indrias. There are ten Indrias. And then there is one subtle indri, which is the third subtle element, which is mind. So put together there are eleven senses. So sometimes it is called ten, sometimes it is eleven, when the mind is also included. Manashtani Indriani prakriti thani karshati. So mind is also sense because the mind controls all the other senses. It is subtle sense. So mind, intelligence, false ego, five great elements, the ten senses and then five sense objects. All the senses have got their object. The tongue has got object taste. Eyes have got object form. In a similar fashion, there are five sense objects. So these are the various elements of field. And then there is combination. When these elements combine together, then what happens? Different things arise, just like sodium is there and chlorine is there. When it interacts, then what happens? Sodium chloride. There is salt, there is hydrogen and there is oxygen. When it interacts, what comes out there is water. So hydrogen is gas, oxygen is gas. But when it combines, it becomes liquid. H, two o. So in a similar fashion, when these various elements of field five great elements, three elements senses, sense, objects they combine together. Thus arise desire, hatred, happiness, distress, the aggregate, the life symptoms and convictions. All these are considered in summary to be the field of activities and its interactions. So thus we have to read this carefully. It is very very important to understand as we had mentioned in the description of the session if a person is perceiving the world in a certain way that is because of this combination of the various elements of field. Interactions of the field. The light falls on an object. There is interaction of the object, the substance and the light. And then there is reflection. The light falls on our eyes. This is again interaction of the field. And then the person will tell the color oh, this is orange, this is green, this is blue. But if the body is of a certain nature then the perception would be different colorblind person will tell this is not green, this is actually brown. He will be perceiving the world in a different way. Similarly, if the body is in different state, there is more fire element in the body. There is fever. Then you put nice food. But the feeling would be different. Bitter taste will come. So the experience of the world changes. And when the field is in certain configuration we like taking food. And when the configuration of the field changes, we hate taking food. Same man and woman, they love each other. After some time they fight with each other. They even kill each other. So why this happens? Because of the change. These are the interactions of field. So unfortunately people take the interactions of field as something belonging to them. The field gives rise to certain desire. We think it is my desire. The field gives rise to certain understanding about life. And we think this understanding is perfect understanding. So we have to understand just like a child was desiring or we also as child were desiring so many things. But now we understand all those things were not making any sense at all. Child, whatever it desires, child simply desires fun. And child will spoil his future life. Because the child's field is like that. For child happiness is something and distress is something else. In a similar fashion we should understand why we are working simply following the results of interaction of the field and taking it as some actual fact. We are thinking oh, this thing will make us happy. This is what I desire. I don't desire. Because of this influence the interaction of the field certain desire arises in me. Just like when the animals see the water in the desert. That is actually a mirage. But animal thinks there is water and animal starts chasing the water. So this desire is created because of the interaction of field. So there was certain gas and the air was traveling because of the temperature. There was total internal reflection and there was water. There was appearance of water. Water was not there. So thus the vedas tell us, they warn us please never get carried away by the things you desire, by the things you hate. By the perceptions of happiness and distress that this field creates for you. The last word is also very important. Life symptoms and convictions. Ichadwaisha sukham dukam sangha tash Chaitana drithihi. Drithi means conviction. We all have certain conviction in life. This thing is good for me. This thing is bad for me. So those people who are Tamsik, their conviction is different. Tamsik people can either follow the path of Impersonalism or Tamsik means ignorance. They are not knowing reality. So Tamsik people can do sense gratification. Tamsik people will worship ghosts. They would be attracted by ghostly worship or they would be attracted by the worship of very ghastly forms. And when they further advance, they start worshipping demigods like Durga Chandi or Lord Shiva. So usually Tamsik people take to such worship. So Lord Shiva has taken great responsibility of delivering Tamsik people and ghostly living entities also. So Lord Shiva is Shuddha Satvik. He is a pure devotee. But he keeps himself in a Tamsik way. He'll be wearing some mundas and all those skulls and would be having ash smeared all over his body. So he takes this Tamsik get up so that Tamsik living entities can also advance in his association. So thus, as per the modes of nature acquired by the living entity as per the field, different convictions are developed. Just like a child is having certain conviction in life. So we all have different convictions. Tamsik person would be having separate conviction. Then when a person rises further towards Rajaguna, they may develop faith on Ganesha, on Lord Brahma and like that. And when they come to Satvaguna, then they develop faith in Lord Vishnu automatically. So thus in this way, as per the field, person will have certain convictions. Somebody would be communist, somebody would be socialist, somebody would be selfish. Somebody would be magnanimous. All these desires, all these convictions what is good for me? What is bad for me, what is right, what is wrong? This is all the result of field of activity. So thus we understand a child should never believe upon his convictions. So why should we depend upon our convictions? Because the convictions are simply the result of field of activity. So we have to understand this is not knowledge. Now I am perceiving this world in a certain way. This is not knowledge. Whatever knowledge, what we call the perception created by our senses, that is simply the interaction of the field of activity in dream also we see various colors and so many other things. It is interaction of the field of activity. So thus if we have to define what the world actually is we cannot depend upon this field. So which is very very illusory it gives different conceptions. Depending upon the modes of nature we acquire its configuration. So if we have to come to the platform of real knowledge then we have to get freed from the influence of this field. So thus Lord Krishna next describes so if a person is advancing on the path of real knowledge not merely the perceptions created by the senses are being mistaken as knowledge then 20 elements will be shown in his behavior. So Lord Krishna describes if a person is advancing in these 20 items then we can understand that such a person is actually advancing in knowledge. Otherwise whatever conviction knowledge we have here simply interaction. So we can understand somebody is born in certain country and he hears Allah Akbar. He will be affiliated and he will develop convictions basis the faith that he has. Somebody is born here. Jaishiram is hearing XYZ he or she will develop certain conviction. Somebody is born in an atheistic place. Mostly he would live like an atheist. So in this way it simply depends upon interaction. Social interaction, interaction with the materials. In this way our convictions are continuously changing. But reality is something completely different from the convictions that we have that we develop here. So one should never depend upon one's convictions as long as one is being influenced by this material nature. Because as per the influence our convictions will keep on changing always. So any sensible man understands this philosophy. One should understand I am different from my mind, my body, my desires, my hatred and my convictions also. So the decisions of my life should never be basis what I desire or what I hate. Because these things will keep on changing. The same object of desire will become object of hatred. Boyfriend becomes object of hatred. After marriage or girlfriend similar thing happens. Why has it happened? There was a long courtship and everything was so nice. And then it changes. So desire becomes hatred and hatred also becomes desire. Happiness becomes distress. Distress becomes happiness. Something I thought will give me pleasure. It has given me great distress. Something I thought is very distressful. It is giving me happiness. So these things keep on changing. So a sensible man should never base should never base his life upon these shaky foundations of desire, hatred, happiness, distress these will keep on changing always. So thus what one should do is one should simply understand where is a person who is not at all influenced by the field. His convictions would be the result of the knowledge which is coming in parampara. So such a person we need to find not a person who is getting influenced by the field. So as long as we are also getting influenced by the field. One should not never depend upon this thing. So as we understand, as long as I'm under the influence of virus in the body, I will never be able to tell what is the real taste of food. In a similar fashion, as long as we are under the influence of this field, we will never be able to understand and tell what is reality. So this is very very important point. So please do not make your decisions of life basis what you desire or what you hate, what is your conviction. So what are the symptoms of such a person who is free from the influence of the field? Which are those elements? So just see, such wonderful knowledge is being described in Bhagavad Gita. So from this we can measure how much we are advancing on the path of real knowledge and which are these elements. Amanitamadambhitvam Mahinsak, shantirajavam acharya passanam Shoms teriyamatma vinigrahah indriyartheshu veragyam manahankara janmamrityo jaravyadhi dukhudoshanudarshanam asaktirana viswanga putradara grihadishu nityamcha samachitratvam ishtanishtopapatishu mai Chananya yogena Bhaktiravya, Biharini vivikta desha sevitvam Aratir janasansa adhyatmagyana nitvatmam tatpagyanam etajanamiti praktam agyanamyad atonyata. So these elements are humility, pridelessness, nonviolence, tolerance, simplicity, approaching a bona fide spiritual master, cleanliness, steadiness and self control. Renunciation of the objects of sense gratification absence of false ego the perception of the evil of birth, death, old age and disease nonattachment to children, wife, home and the rest. An even mindedness amid pleasant and unpleasant events, constant and unalloyed devotion to me resorting to solitary places, detachment from the general mass of people accepting the importance of self realization and philosophical search for the absolute truth. All these I thus declare to be knowledge and what is contrary to these is ignorance. So all these items are very very important. Shila Prabhupada explains this process of knowledge is sometimes misunderstood by less intelligent men as being the interaction of the field of activity. So as the material sciences we acquire, which are simply the interaction of the field of activity so some less intelligent people tell, humility, nonviolence all these qualities are also interaction of the field. But it is not actually. This is the real process of knowledge. If one accepts this process, then the possibility of approaching the Absolute Truth exists. This is not the interaction of the tenfold elements as described before. This is actually the means to get out of it. Of all the descriptions of the process of knowledge, the most important is described in the first line of the 10th verse the process of knowledge terminates in unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. mamcha nanya yogena bhaktir avyabicharani so bhaktir aviabhi Charani is very important. Unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. So if one does not approach or is not able to approach the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other 19 items are of no particular value. You wanted to travel towards your destination, you covered all the milestones, but you could not reach last milestone then the entire journey is of no use. So better you would have sat at home only because reaching destination serves the purpose. So in a similar fashion, all the other elements should reach eventually to this final milestone. And what is that? Devotional service unto me experiencing love of God. So if devotional service, loving service is not developed, all other items are of no use. Or if a person somehow he is fortunate to meet pure devotee of Krishna and develops unalloyed devotional service to Lord, then all other elements will manifest automatically. So if one does not approach or is not able to approach the transcendental service of the Lord, then the other 19 items are of no particular value. Very important to understand humility, morality, truthfulness, all these things. What is the value? If you die again and again, you repeat next birth and you forget everything. So ultimately the purpose should be solved. So all the other things of this life are of no use if this final element is not achieved. But if one takes to devotional service in full Krishna consciousness the other 19 items automatically develop within him the principle of accepting a spiritual master. As mentioned in the 7th verse Achary Upasanam people ask why should we worship any middleman? I will worship God directly. God is telling you how to worship a middleman. Acharya upasana worshipping the acharya. Taking shelter of acharya is very very important element. Just like by reading books, nobody becomes a doctor. So simply by reading Bhagavad Gita, Prabhupada mentions you read Bhagavad Gita 1000 times. As people tell I finished bhagavad gita 20 times. But if you ask them what is Krishna? They will not be able to describe because they did not surrender to a pure devotee spiritual master. So thus without internship, it is not possible at all to make any advancement simply by reading books. So transcendental life begins even it is mentioned here. For one who takes to devotional service, it is most important. Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. So please read the line again. Transcendental means spiritual beyond the material nature. Transcendental life begins when one accepts a bona fide spiritual master. So that is why we should be very very eager to get clarity and then to surrender to such a bona fide spiritual master. Here is a person whom I can surrender completely. And when a person is able to accept, that is a beginning of life. The Supreme Personality of Goddess Sri Krishna clearly states here that this process of knowledge is the actual path. Anything speculated beyond this is nonsense. Now Srila Prabhupada gives a very very nice analysis of all these elements. As for the knowledge outlined here, the items may be analyzed as follows humility. Now what is this humility? I want to see whether I am humble or not. So how do I understand it? So Prabhupada explains very beautifully what is humility? Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others. But from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge who knows that he is not this body, anything honor or dishonor pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this material deception. People are very anxious to be famous for their religion. And consequently sometimes it is found that without understanding the principles of religion one enters into some group which is not actually following religious principles and then wants to advertise himself as a religious mentor. So Prabhupada explains what is humility. Not being anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. It is a deception. So one who understands that he is not the body, shetra and shetragnya I am, nor of this body, nor of the field. Then what is the use of any honor or dishonor? Any honor praise is for the body. If I am wearing a mask and somebody tells you are very beautiful should I think I am beautiful? The mask which I am wearing might be beautiful, but I am not. I may not be. Or if the mask I'm wearing is ugly and people are very much bothered I should look beautiful. They undergo cosmetic surgery and spend so much of money. If the body which I have got is less intelligent. So that means simply this computer is not advanced enough. I should not feel low that I am less intelligent. If I'm living in a situation where wealth is less I should not think I am poor. All the wealth belongs to Krishna. If I use that wealth for my enjoyment then misery will happen in life. Thus even the rich people are very miserable because they think that wealth belongs to them. It is not right. All the wealth belongs to Krishna. So those people who use all the wealth for Krishna they are always very happy and satisfied. Those who keep on accumulating, they are never satisfied by all their accumulation of wealth. So simply thinking if the wealth in which I am sitting, this belongs to me. And feeling you are rich, this is also ignorance. Or I am not having enough wealth around me. It does not matter. This temporary setup and that wealth anyway belongs to God. If God wants me to serve him with less wealth, it is okay, I'll serve with less wealth. But if this understanding is not there that I am different from the body then a person will get carried away. And thus there's great deception. Thus people are working very very hard. So tomorrow we are taking a stroll with one of the devotees and we are discussing. So one guard was sitting there very peacefully entire day. They keep on sitting and usually they'll be having their phones with them. Would be watching their phones entire day. So it is such a nice job. Guard job. There is no deadline, there is no pressure. You sit down entire day. You can chant. So just like the garden, our building in association he has learned. So I got to know sometimes he's chanting 32 rounds also. And he has started chanting eight rounds without knowing much philosophy. Simply by association. Association or devotees is so powerful. So it is such a nice job. You can entire day you are sitting there. You need not run here and there. You can keep on chanting entire day. Keep on reading entire day, keep on hearing entire day. Your spiritual life would be successful. But then what people would think I am guard, I am security officer. No. So unfortunately all of us have been trained in this material concept. You should make the people around you proud. You should be proud of yourself. So this pride is a pillar of spiritual life. And we want to have more and more pride. Yes, I am rich. I am intelligent, I'm successful. So spiritual means this pride should never be there. Pride is the enemy of spiritual life and we want to build it. Just see the material conception of life. And because of this the poor child is working very very hard to study. Studying 10 hours, 12 hours, 15 hours. So yes, you study very nicely. But if you are getting some result, poor child is getting more and more stressed out and the stress keeps on increasing. So what is the use of such education? Every endeavor should be so that I increase my happiness in life but no deception. So this deception of honor kills the living entities life after life. Everybody is always working hard just to maintain status quo in the society. Because they are not humble, everybody is anxious. So that is our training. We are all anxious. We want to be honored by others. If I don't perform nicely, oh honor will go down. If I do the honor so thus spiritual life begins from here. Humility. Lord Jesus also mentioned kingdom of God is meant for meek and humble. So one should not be anxious to have satisfaction of being honored by others. Others honor me or others criticize me, I should be completely unaffected. We are just travelers. We have assembled here for a while. So please do not worry. Do not waste this human form of life. Every moment is very precious. If we waste it for temporary gains which are anyway never satisfactory, why should we waste our life like that? Rather I should use every moment in the service of Krishna. When we use our resources, our time, our energy in service of Krishna, krishna is there in the heart. He has created all the field, its interactions, whatever pleasures we get of taste, form, sound, these are all created by Krishna. So that is why Krishna means the reservoir of all pleasure also and the greatest pleasure also. So Krishna is greatest pleasure. If he is happy 24 hours. We'll be feeling pleasure in the heart 24 hours. Not when I put my favorite food on my tongue, I'll be happy. Not when I meet the person I am infatuated to, I'll be happy. I'll be always happy. 24 hours in loving attraction of service of Krishna. So we should not be satisfied by this flickering satisfaction. So we should be very very careful implementing this first element of knowledge in our life. We should try to become humble. And thus another understanding is we don't surrender to Krishna because of this. We think if I get honor in this world then will be happy. If I save time from my material things and invest time in Krishna, what will happen to me? Then people stop respecting me. That means I'm not humble. Krishna is telling you, surrender unto me. But I'm not willing to surrender completely. So if you are not following God, then where is the question of humility? So anybody who is little bowing down to others and speaking politely that is not real humility. Because they are not willing to surrender to Krishna. So when we are not willing to listen to God follow completely God's advice. Who is our loving Father, eternal relative then where is a question of humility? So that is why only a devotee can be humble. He completely follows God. So people criticize devotee for devotional service or he gets some praise. He is not at all affected. So thus we should try not to get affected by dissatisfaction of being honored by others. Otherwise entire life we have to work very very hard and struggle just to garner this honor by others. Then next, nonviolence is generally taken to mean not killing or destroying the body. But actually nonviolence means not to put others into distress. So another element of knowledge is nonviolence. So a person is very learned. He has cracked IIT and he has cracked UPSC. And he or she is an Is officer. And then they are eating meat very nicely. So sir, what is the use of your knowledge? You are giving pain to other living entities. Does it need rocket science to understand that I should not hurt other living entities? They also want to live with family. They have their own plans of enjoyment. So our life is not very different from them. They want to enjoy eating, waiting, sleeping, defending. We want to enjoy eating, waiting, sleeping, defending. Why should we kill them? Give pain to them? So this simple understanding does not dawn upon somebody. Then what is the use of cracking all these big exams that this knowledge is not actually knowledge. The simply interaction of the field of activity Prabhupada in the morning. He was explaining very nicely in a class. Just like technician. If technician comes to our place to fix some light bulb switches and other things pumps do we call a very learned man has come to our. Place technician? No technician or mechanics they are not very intelligent similarly engineer is nothing but an extension or scientist is nothing but extension of mechanic or technician so this is not real knowledge. This simply the interaction of field put this element here, put this atom here, put this chip and combine this simply interaction of the field of activity that is not called real knowledge. So this is knowledge. These elements should be developed so don't we understand? Is it not knowledge? This is knowledge. If I am hurting other living entity that living entity feels pain why should I give pain to others? This sense does not strike then where is knowledge? There is no knowledge actually in society so a person in knowledge will advance in nonviolence automatically and what does it mean nonviolence? Simply not hurting the body, which is generally perceived. No, nonviolence means not putting others into distress. So because hurting the body hurts others, so that is why it is also called violence. People in general are trapped by ignorance in the material concept of life and they perpetually suffer material pains. So unless one elevates people to spiritual knowledge, one is practicing violence. So this is very important. So if the parents are telling child, you become very famous man in this world you should desire to become famous. You should desire to become rich. Then the parents are actually the killers of the child. Because of this desire to become famous desire to become rich the child has developed material desires. And the nature of material desires are that they are never satiated. Today I am ten x famous. I want to become 100 x famous tomorrow then 1000 x famous then next life I have to take birth again just to fulfill these never satiating desires. So actually the parents are killing their children by giving them these false theories. So this life is full of misery. So the nature of this material world is misery cannot be solved. To get certain happiness, you have to take another misery. You want to eat food then you have to cultivate food work very hard in the farm and then you can enjoy food or you have to work hard somewhere, get money and then take food so misery has to be taken. This is called sense. There is actually no happiness here. Happiness of enjoying nice food item means you have to work hard to raise that food item. Either you grow directly in the field or you work hard, get some money and get food from that so thus misery is fixed in this material world, you want name and fame then you have to toil very hard. You have to do tapas work very hard. So thus misery is fixed. Any kind of happiness means we have to take misery. You want to have a child then there is misery of pregnancy so much of pain is there but a person has to undergo that pain. If you want child. And then there are so many other responsibilities which are also but misery. But if you want to have enjoyment of family then you have to undergo all such troubles also. So thus actually there is no happiness. Don't we see happiness is another phase of misery or misery is another phase of happiness. To have some kind of happiness you have to have certain misery here. So thus taking people out of this material cycle completely that is actually called nonviolence. So we should never engage our near and dear ones or anybody whatsoever in material desires. Because material desires means misery. You have to undergo pains to enjoy something in this material world. So devotee preaches Krishna consciousness very nicely. So thus how devotee only can be non violent. Otherwise whole world is violent. Simply violent. Because everyone is simply government is making plans so that material desires can be fulfilled. Material desires are never fulfilled. The more you fulfill, the more it will increase. And then next birth again living entity tries. Then next birth. In this way perpetual misery continues here. So one should try his best to distribute real knowledge to the people. So if somebody is there just like Yudhishthir Maharaj when he saw people are suffering on the war battlefield then he was going and taking care of their wounds. So in a similar fashion everybody's suffering simply because of is it not very nice? Knowledge out of the box knowledge all the very simple common sense. But we don't hear these things. It is such a wonderful knowledge. Nobody shows this face of the material world. Because how much ever you interact in this material world this knowledge will never come. This descent is in the Guru parampara. When we read Bhagavad Gita as it is come in contact with pure devotee such things enlighten us. So that is why people are suffering simply because of this thing ignorance. So just like a person who distributes medicines to the suffering people that is called real nonviolence. Similarly we should distribute these literatures as much as possible. Distribute this knowledge as much as much as possible. So that they may become enlightened and leave this material entanglement that is nonviolence. So nonviolence means spreading this knowledge to others. So in this way we should practice humility, pridelessness and nonviolence. Then next another very important element amanitvam Adam Vitwam. There should be no man, there should be no DAMB pride. There should be no hinsa and there should be Shantihi. Shantihi means tolerance. What is the meaning of tolerance? Tolerance means that one should be practiced to bear insult and dishonor from others. If one is engaged in the advancement of spiritual knowledge there will be so many insults and much dishonor from others. Because people are in ignorance. So when a person advances seriously wants to advance in spiritual life as has been the life of great devotees also so much of dishonor will be there. So many insults. A devotee has to meet with. So devotee has to be. That is why very, very tolerant. If someone cannot tolerate, one cannot be devotee, one cannot advance. Even a boy like Prahlad, who only five years old, was engaged in cultivation of spiritual knowledge, was put into so many difficulties endangered when his father became antagonistic to his devotion. Father tried to kill him in so many ways, but paralla tolerated. So for making advancement in spiritual knowledge there may be many impediments, but we should be tolerant and continue our progress with determination. So thus the same understanding what Lord Krishna is explaining here has been repeated by Chattana Mahaprabhin Shikstakam which has been mentioned as foremost order of Sunni chena taro riva sahishna devotees should be humbler than the grass and more tolerant than the tree. So then spiritual life begins only a person who is humbler than the grass not I do not desire any honor in this material world and I am ready to bear all insults and dishonor. So such a person only can actually relish chanting of Hare Krishna Mahamantra otherwise chanting would be mechanical that pleasure will not be awakened within the heart. So tolerance and humility is very much required. And then ahinsak shanti arjavam arjavam means simplicity. So nobody wants to be simple. People want to become more and more flashy, they want to show off and that is material life all about arjuna tells if I kill my relatives, what is the use of kingdom? Kingdom we earn and show to our relatives and then they praise us and then we feel happy. So a person should not try to show off. Simple simplicity means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward. We know simple people, right means that without diplomacy one should be so straightforward that he can disclose the real truth even to an enemy. As for acceptance of the so very simple simplicity means very simple person he can reveal truth even to the enemy. So a person who has crooked heart there is no possibility of advancement in spiritual life such simplicity is very much required. So the more devotee advances in spiritual knowledge, more and more the devotee becomes simple and then very important element insa shantir arjavam acharya passanam shosham acharya passna as for acceptance of the spiritual master, this is very very important because without the instruction of bona fide spiritual master one cannot progress in the spiritual existence. So the greatest wealth that a person can acquire in life is instruction from a spiritual master. Just like a person who has gone in the well dark well so one who has fallen in such a place, he cannot come out on his own. So what is the way? If a person drops a rope from outside holding that rope, the person can come out similarly now in this material world we may keep on going to various universities, keep on meeting with various so called learned people but it is nothing but interaction of the field of activity. We will never be able to come to the platform of real knowledge. So how a person can come out of this material existence? That rope is the instruction of the spiritual master. So nobody can advance in spiritual life without following the instruction of the spiritual master and Spiritual Master does not give instruction unless he sees the disciple is submissive. If spiritual master gives instruction and we don't follow, then that is an offense. Thus Jesus Christ told there are many things which I want to tell you, but you cannot bear them now. So thus, despite his willingness he was not able to elevate them to the highest platform of spiritual life. Thus Lord Krishna also could have spoken the most confidential instruction of Bhagavad Gita in the beginning but Lord Krishna was hesitant. Arjuna may not understand. So thus the most confidential knowledge was explained at last finally so in a similar fashion, unless the disciple is very gentle submissive surrender to spiritual master spiritual Master will not give instruction because if a person disobeys instruction that is an offense. So spiritual Master will not give instruction at all. So this instruction is the wealth if a person gets an instruction from spiritual Master and if he follows, life is successful. So thus why 16 rounds? Why four regulative principles? It is being asked because this is instruction of the spiritual master. If spiritual master tells you take up this water pot and you fill it 100 times, empty it 100 times simply if you do that activity, that activity will make our spiritual life perfect. It is the instruction of the spiritual master which is the greatest wealth. By following that spirit the devotee advances in spiritual life. So thus acharya upasanam is very very important element and Lord Krishna is recommending here one should accept a bona fide spiritual master and worship the spiritual master. One should approach a spiritual master now very important element with all humility and offer him all services. So this is mentioned in the fourth chapter we have seen previously pranipatain pari prashnayana sevaya. So one should be very very humble before spiritual master should never challenge the spiritual master and one should be very gentle. One should please spiritual master by gentle behavior and one should render service also pranipate and pari prashnini sevaya. If service is not rendered then inquiries will not be beneficial and those instructions will not fructify in the heart, it will simply fall on the ears and go away. So thus pranipathe pariprashini sevaya seva is very important and humility is also very important. So humble devotee if he renders seva and then when he inquires then knowledge is given by spiritual master and disciple is able to realize it. One should approach the spiritual master with all humility and offer him all services. So that is why the devotees are very very eager. So that is why this is the way we should approach saintly person. As soon as we approach the saintly person the first question should be we are very very eager. So it's okay to ask many questions. But those who are sincere people who understand how does spiritual life develop? The first question should be vishala Prabhupada tells I never asked spiritual master because many many people were asking questions to Srila Prabhupada and how Prabhupada can answer questions of thousands of people. So he pointed some governing body representatives, some of the senior disciples, temple presidents and he was recommending disciples you please ask your local authorities, ask temple president, ask the devotees there and in this way ask your senior God brothers. They will give you the answers. But still if they are not able to answer you then you can write to me also. But all these answers will be revealed when you engage in devotional service and read my books. So Prabhupada explained it is by devotional service save one mukhi Javada. The more we render service to Krishna automatically all the doubts are resolved. From the heart complete conviction, clear knowledge is awakened. Thus Prabhupada said never asked my spiritual master any question but one. And that question was how can I serve you? So thus whenever we meet any saintly person, any devotee whenever you come across so before asking any question we should ask this question how can I serve you? And then we should try to serve. And then we should ask whatever we want. And then without any reservation then the devotees will give knowledge. This is the way of getting the spiritual knowledge in life. This is very very important. Sevaya. So first question should be how can I serve you? And then we should try to serve, fulfill, carry out the instructions and then without asking question also the knowledge would be revealed. Bhaktisdhan Maharaj explained this very famous educator leader of the country approached and he was not willing to ask to any other person because he was very famous man in the country. He wanted to ask Bhaktistan Maharaj. But bhaktis Dhan Maharaj told him to clean the to help some Brahmacharis who were cleaning the plates of the deities. And he was anyway having very great respect because Bhaktisnan Maharaj was very stalwart, very famous in India at that time. So he approached and he started helping the disciples. And then actually all the questions got answered. Then Bhaktisan Maharaj asked him your questions got answered. He told yes Maharaj, thank you so much. So this is very important. So why a spiritual master is important? Because without satisfying spiritual master there is no question of advancement in spiritual life. So for making advancement in spiritual knowledge there may be many impediments. But if a person has spiritual master then all the impediments Prabhupada tells you are talking of so many stumbling blocks. You simply follow my instructions. All the stumbling blocks will go away. I will remove all the stumbling blocks with one stroke of my kick. You simply follow my instructions because a bona fide spiritual master is representative of Krishna. Very important Prabhupada mentions here. If he bestows any blessings upon the disciple, that will make the disciple immediately advanced without disciples following the regulative. Principles. So we have to follow so many regulations. Get up at Brahmurta in the morning, take cold water bath, then do mangalaarti, then do chanting, then hear Bhagavatam and then you honor only Krishna Prasadam. Then you engage in seva in certain way. Then you come in the evening, do evening program, don't do meat eating, no intoxication, no gambling, no illicit sex, no pajalpa and so many other things. Are there so, so many rules and regulations have to be followed. But if the Spiritual Master becomes pleased with the disciple disciple can make advancement without following the regulative principles or following regulative principles becomes very easy. It is very difficult to get up in the morning. My job is very tight. Everything will be resolved if spiritual master becomes pleased. I'm not able to follow Brahmacharya. Many lusty thoughts are coming. Everything is resolved is the spiritual master is pleased so thus blessing of spiritual master is very adav, guru. Ashrayam. Thus it is told in chatta and Charitamrita, take shelter of a guru, first of all, render service unto him, and then spiritual life will develop. So these elements actually are there should be one class. On every element. Maybe we'll make a separate course on us all the elements. So for now, you can try to contemplate upon each and every element. I think we may take one class at least to finish the remaining items.
