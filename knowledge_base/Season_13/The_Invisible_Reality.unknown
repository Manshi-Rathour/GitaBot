So in the previous session we saw Lord Krishna is explaining one who knows the science concerning the field of activities and the knower of the field shetra and Gya. This is called actual knowledge. And one who knows this scientifically factually such a person does not entangle himself in the process of repeated birth and death. And who can understand this that also Lord Krishna has mentioned bhakta devotee can understand. So now we have some knowledge of this body. The science of anatomy, medical science in medical college you understand few things. But those are very basic things that is very very gross. So actually modern medical science is not very advanced. It is advanced in one sense that in life saving situations it is very helpful because yes, in Ayurveda also it is a great science in life saving situation that also is helpful and rather that science also was very advanced. Some sages like Shukracharya. They were knowing this. Sanjeevini Vidya. Mr. Sanjeevini. And any person who is having untimely death if timely death happens nobody can bring him back except Krishna or the pure devotees. They have all the power. Because pure devotee is directly connected to Krishna. So Krishna gives them all their power. But unless pure devotee or Krishna's involvement is there nobody can bring back a person from death. But untimely death yes Bristan Jeevini some accident happens in war soldiers die. So in such untimely death they can be brought back to life. So such sciences were there but now of course it is lost. We don't have many such qualified physicians in that ancient science. So modern medical science helps in that respect. But still fine things cuff with VAT and all these other things constitution of the body is not known to them. And the nature is designed in such a beautiful way that all the ingredients are there to maintain a good physical body. So Ayurveda defines how your lifestyle should be, how your thought process should be. Because Ayurveda is coming from God Dhanwantri himself. His incarnation of Krishna. And thus it is explained that how all the diseases, 90% of them, they have origin in the mind. So one devotee shared recently he was having many many problems and then he visited an Ayurvedic doctor. So doctor told him that simply try to keep yourself happy. And of course Krishna's engagement in Krishna's service is best happiness. So that is why even though we are devotee we have to very strictly follow the principles. So if we very strictly follow we'll be happy. So he told just try to be happy and then all your problems will most of them will be solved automatically. And then he told just please follow my advice for six months and then you will see the change in your health. And the devotee he was knowing Krishna consciousness very nicely applied himself very sincerely in the practices and what to speak of. Six months he revived his health in one and a half months and doctor was surprised very quick recovery. It is very very difficult. So Ayurveda knows this thing that psychosomatic disease is what medical science also is admitting now. Power of subconscious mind. So many things people are using now and they are telling I am able to cure my disease simply by utilizing this power of mind through mind everything is coming. So thus vedas define very beautifully. If you want to maintain a proper health then we have to take shelter of such knowledge. But still some superficial knowledge we have in modern medical sciences, anatomy. But that is not sufficient. We need to have knowledge of three Dhatus. Kav, Pitavat and further there are more seven Dhatus. And these Dhatus are coming from the gunas. Gunas we do not know which are conducting just like a puppet show is going on. So what we see on the screen is puppets dancing very nicely and a person get amazed oh what is this doll dancing and shaking hands so beautifully. But he does not know doll is not independent. Somebody is pulling the strings, the puppeteer. We don't see puppeteer, we don't see the strings. So the strings are three modes of nature satvaguna Rajaguna Tamaguna they are moving us. So this is the actual knowledge of the field. When a person knows the gunas, the three strings satvaguna rajoguna Tamaguna guna means rope and guna means quality. So basis these qualities that we acquire, we are controlled by the nature. And then of course, even though we have some knowledge of the field, there is no knowledge of the knower of field whatsoever. And what to speak of understanding. There are two noirs of the field. As Lord Krishna explained in the beginning of this chapter shetragya chap Imam with the service sheetrishubharata Atma and Parmatma. So one who knows this is actually in knowledge, simply imperfect knowledge. Superficial knowledge of field is not going to help. You have to have perfect knowledge of the truth. That is shetra and gya. So a devotee can have perfect knowledge. Lord Krishna has already described this thing. And thus a devotee can surpass all the miseries of this world and surpass the repeated birth and death also. So how do people develop this knowledge of of which is very very difficult? Who is not at all visible, shetragya is seeing everything. But how to see Shetragya, how to see myself individual soul and how to see the super soul? So people follow various process apart from devotional service, devotional service krishna has made clear they are actually seeing now other processes also. Krishna mentions here in verse number 25 as you can see on the screen diana atmanipashanti kechid Atmana matmana anay sankena yogena karma yogena Chapari Atmanipashanti. Atmana means self. So by Dhyana meditation that super soul is perceived by some through meditation. So this meditation as we see it is farce what people are teaching today. New meditation, new yogas are coming up. So we have discussed this enough in our basic workshops. So Dhyanamis Lord Krishna is mentioning here to know to meditate upon the shetragya this Dhyana happens. Who is this? The description is given in the scriptures. In Sankhya yoga kapilmun is describing to Devahuti. So super soul is having a yellow dress. He's standing on the lotus world and then he's having club disc and all these weapons in his hands and he's having a helmet and so many jewels and in this way he's smiling and this is the size. In this way a person imagines the form of Shatragya SuperSoul within the heart and meditates. And in this way imagining and meditating he is purifying himself. And then he searches for SuperSoul within the heart. And then finally when he is able to find the SuperSoul he becomes a devotee and then he advances to the perfection of yoga. Bhakti Yoga. So some people sit in meditation and in this way they try to find the supersol within the heart. So this is the purpose of super meditation. It is not on some void, some breast, some other object XYZ that is not real meditation. That is cheating process. So that SuperSoul is perceived by some through meditation dhyan, Atmana, Pashyanti as it is mentioned here that super soul is perceived by meditation dhyana vastitatad gate and by some through the cultivation of knowledge Sankhya by others through working without fruitive desire. Karma Yoga, Nacha, Apari and some others try by working without fruitive desires. Materialist works with fruitive desire. As we discussed. I'm sorry, we did not discuss here. We discussed in some other session the Karma Yoga. What is this? Karma yoga? So working to enjoy the result of activity that is called Karma and working so that I can offer the results of my activity to Krishna. That is called Karma yoga. So some people realize super soul by Dhyana meditation. Some of them realize by Sankhya, some of them by Karma. Karma yoga. Process. In this way various means are adopted. And these people who take to different processes they are elevated to the platform of Bhakti yoga. And then they develop a perfect vision of the super soul. Then now this Shloka is very important. There is another category who are not so qualified. If you have to have meditation as your way then it's not at all possible. In Kaliyuga, even in Dwapar, Yuga and Trita yoga it is very difficult. It is meant for Satyuga. Mind should be very very peaceful. Senses should be very controlled and body should be very strong. So that you can sit firmly without food, without water. So we do not have such physical and mental strength capacity and it needs a very long time to perfect. So it needs extraordinary qualifications to take to such a process of Dhyan yoga and similarly Gyan Yoga. Also to follow Gyan yoga you need to have perfect memory. You keep on reading Sankhya, keep on analyzing and once you have finished all the vedas reading two times, three times over and over again. With perfect memory you analyze in this way you may be able to reach some conclusion. But when memory itself is not perfect, we forget what we have just heard ten minutes ago. Then where is the question of arriving to any conclusion? So thus it is a hopeless situation for us people in Kaluga. In that sense, if we don't take to this process which is mentioned here in this verse shutvane upasati. If we don't take to this, then it is hopeless. Because there is no capacity to do Dhyana in the Himalayas. There is no capacity to use knowledge and intelligence. Because memory does not stay. Anything we read, we forget. We will never be able to arrive to a perfect conclusion. Only the thing we are exposed to those things will remain in our brain. And Karma yoga can be followed. Yes, that is possible. But Karma Yoga also in this today's situation of so much intense lust and greed people are so much attached to the results of activity. Very difficult to give up. And even though they give up, it's a very gradual process. So there are other people who might not be able to follow any of these processes. Still they can make their life perfect. And what is that Lord Krishna mentions? Anathwevamajanantah shutvane tepi chatitaranteva mrithyam shutiparayanah again there are those who, although not conversant in spiritual knowledge, begin to worship the supreme person upon hearing about him from others. Because of their tendency to hear from authorities, they also transcend the path of birth and death. Mrityam shruti Parayana So everywhere Krishna is telling mrithyam atitaranti cross over this repeated death why you are dying? Nap nuanti Mahatmana some siddhim paramam gataha they don't return here to this world which is full of misery dukalayama Shashvatam tam so ma jokama do not die everywhere it is being told please stop your death. Stop your death. This is the prime objective of life. Death is very painful. Diseases are painful. Old age is painful. Birth is very, very painful. So please stop this death. This is the aim of life. Dashrath Maharaj when Sage Vishwamitra came to meet him, he asked ayistam yatat punar Janma jayaya punar Janma jayaya how is your process? Because when we meet each other, Prabhupada explains normally we ask about our family members, about our property, business, animals, pets and what to speak when we are meeting with a Sage. Sage has none of these things. So the king was knowing what is a business in which sages have involved themselves into very serious business. The greatest scientific affair of stopping the death altogether. The richest person of the planet is now investing so that his death can be stopped. But this is the science here how you can stop your death. So all the sages punar Janma jayaya So he's telling how are your endeavors going on to win over this process of repeated birth and death? Ayistamyata Punar Janma jayaya So we should always keep this mind, not get illusioned by these temporary happiness what this world offers to us in exchange for tremendous distress we should know we have an eternal place, eternal reality. God is living with many, many people, our creator eternally and everybody has opportunity to live with Him eternally if we choose to, if we desire so. But this desire is not easy. Srila Prabhupada tells so we should go back to Godhead after this life. We should be very, very serious about it that we should get the ticket to go back to Godhead in this life. And what is the price for that ticket? How we can purchase the ticket to travel back? We can purchase a ticket to go to Delhi we can purchase a ticket to go to New York, Amsterdam but how to go back to Godhead? Golovrindavan. So the price for that Srila Prabhupada explains the scriptures mentioned is usually we are able to get the price by our good karma. By our good karma. We get some wealth, we get money. And then from money we purchase travel tickets, we afford many other enjoyments of life. But scriptures tell no amount of good karma can give you this ticket of going back to Godhead. Janmukoti sukrathar nalabhyate janmakoti good karma you keep on doing unlimited. Charity you do unlimited hospitals you open and unlimited vedas you study yajna you do tapasya you do it is not possible to purchase a ticket of going back to Godhead but still ticket is purchasable and we should be very serious to purchase the ticket so how we can purchase it? So thus it is mentioned in the Vedas tattra Lolamapi Muliam what is the cost of this ticket? Loliam intense desire to have it so in that sense spiritual life is very easy simply by desiring person can attain perfection of spiritual life but what kind of desire? Intense desire loliam means intense greed or intense hankering to have it? Yes I want to make my spiritual life perfect I want to relish the Hare Krishna Mahamantra why I am not getting the pleasure? So many people, so many devotees they have relished the process they are relishing the process why I am not able to relish it? Srimad Bhagavatam has got so much of taste that it is mentioned once a person tastes Srimad Bhagavatam Nanyatrasyadhrati Kwachit he will not get taste in any other thing but reading Srimad Bhagavatam why I am not able to get that taste? So when we become very very eager for it then that is the cost of our spiritual life. Either getting taste in Bhagavatam in the Holy Name either seeing Krishna or going back to Godhead or engaging in devotional service of Krishna in nectar of devotion. It is mentioned the devotee should know how to cry for devotional service. So one should be very very eager. Intense eagerness should be their intense desire. So intense desire in that sense it is easy. Somehow if we can have that intense desire then we can go back to Godhead. Then entire spiritual life would be revealed. But this intense desire is not awakened very easily. This is a difficulty. So how do we develop such desire? So it is very simple. How do we develop any desire? In this material world? We did not take birth with any of such desires which we have now. But all these desires we have developed by association. We associated with certain people who told us yes, when you grow up you have to go to army. When you have to grow up, you have to become a civil servant. When you have to grow up, you have to become engineer, doctor. You have to go to IIT IAM or Ames or like that people give various and then we think oh yes, this is my life, my desire. I should follow it. So by association we develop certain desires. We associated with a beautiful man. I desired, oh, I want to live with this man always. Or a woman, this woman should be my life partner. We develop desire by association. Movie showed us oh, if you have a person like this and life is so nice and nice music is playing in the background and they live happily ever after. And we get carried away by the scam and we think we also will live happily ever after. So by association we develop desires. And what is association? Real association means hearing. So Bedbug is also having association of any person. But it will simply suck the blood of the person. So that is not real association. Real association means hearing. So that is why Lord Krishna is telling here those people again there are those who although not conversant in spiritual knowledge. So one needs to have spiritual knowledge to make spiritual life perfect. But if there is no spiritual knowledge still spiritual life can be perfect by ordinary people. Yes. Yatma, Buddhi, Konapatridhatoki, Swadhi, Kalatradishubham so those people who do not have advanced knowledge of supersol staying within the heart and they choose I should meditate upon supersol. Find out within the heart they have no knowledge of SuperSoul. They have no capacity and no inquisitiveness to understand who am I? I'm different from this body. Let me understand what is reality? What is this world? Who is the creator? They are just satisfied. Let me somehow become famous in this world. Let me people praise me. Just like a dog wants to attract the attention of she dog and vice versa like that all the species are doing that. We also waste our life. They use some other dances and by expanding their wings and flying and dancing in a certain way peacock will show this thing. We show our resume, our bank balance. But same activities of animal trying to attract the attention of opposite sex. And the people around us and getting some money for enjoyment. That is animal life. So Shastras mentioned Gokhara? Yes. Jatma buddhi kunapedridhatuke. If you are thinking I am this bag of pus mucus and bile, I am this body, then Gokhara, that animal also thinks like that. So people like us, all of us who are like Gokhara, what is the hope for us? So this is the hope. Shutbha nevya upasate. So those in bodily concept of life also begin to worship supreme person upon hearing about him from others. Because of their tendency to somehow we should have this tendency of hearing. So if a person is gentle, he has tendency of hearing. Then because of their tendency to hear from authorities sorry. They also transcend the path of birth and death. So simply this hearing process is what is being stressed here. When Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was asking Ramanandrai to describe what is sadhya and what is sadhana, what is the aim of life and how to attain what is the process of attaining the aim of life. Then Ramanandrai started with one Ashrama system. Brahmana kshatriya vaishya shudra. So to bring a person to the platform of Kshetra and Agna needs immense training. Mind and senses should be controlled. And then a person will be able to perceive atmanipashyanti with clean mind. Just like when the dust from the mirror is cleansed, we are able to see our face. We will be able to see ourselves through mind. When this dust of rajoguna Tamuguna lust and greed is removed. When a person is not at all greedy, he simply satisfied just keeping the body and soul together. There is no lust at all. Then we are able to perceive ourself within the body and the super soul. So such people are called Brahmanas. So the Varnashama system promotes a person. It is not a system which people are telling this Hinduism oppression of the lower classes. No? Yes, there are classes but not for the oppression, for the elevation. There are different chapters in a book for systematic elevation in knowledge. There are different gradations in school for systematic elevation in education. So everybody is supposed to get elevated to Brahmanical platform. Unless a person becomes Brahmana, mind and senses are controlled. Person is living very simply and person is having strong faith in the vedas. He's practicing Tapasya austerity in life. He's practicing forgiveness. There is no question of understanding. As long as we are affected by the waves of material nature, we cannot be still without such stillness. We cannot understand the GNA within this body, the nurse of the field soul and the super soul. So thus Chaitanya Mahaprabhu told please suggest something better. This is not possible now. Van Ashrama is practically not there. So Mahaprabhu told tell something better. So Ramanandrai told Sara Dharman parityA JAMA may come. Sharanam Raja so vanashrama is a gradual process. If Shudra does duty very nicely, he may elevate slowly become Vaishya may in the next life become Kshatriya or a Brahmana like that. But there is one process. Even though the current body is not at all suitable for Brahminical qualifications and Brahmanical understanding, still if we do one thing, it is tremendously effective. And what is that? Sarvadharman parityA Jam akam shanam Raja Mami parth vyapashritya Sri Shudra tatha Vesha Te pcupionia so body of businessmen, traders, farmers and the body of working class. Everybody's working now and women. So it is very very difficult for these bodies to realize spiritual knowledge. But they also can understand perfect spiritual knowledge. They need not attain to wait for a Brahmanical body. So thus all of us fall in this category. So how we can attain perfection? We need not wait for a slow process, but simply sardharman parityA, Ja Makam Sharanam Raja simply by completely surrendering to Krishna. Because when we surrender to Krishna, a child could be trying to drive a car. And there could be a person who is just learning to drive. He's an adult. So child can if he try to drive very soon, he'll meet with an accident. Other person can drive in little careful way. But if both of them surrender to an expert driver, then there is no risk. The car will go on nicely. So when we surrender to Krishna, Krishna takes charge. Then imperfections of mind and body does not matter. Krishna will guide directly either personally or in the disciplic succession. So simply we have to surrender. But then Chaitanya Mahaprabhu understood that this process is definitely very effective. Complete surrenderance. But people are so fallen. Go Khara if you tell a dog that you please surrender unto me, I will stop your death. You'll be happy. Will dog surrender? No dog is bound to act as per the body which dog has acquired. So thus dogs, cows, asses and all of us who are also like animals, who are trained like animals, we cannot even surrender to Krishna easily. So what is hope for us? Then Chaitanya Mahaprabhu told EHO Bahaya this is also external, please tell something more effective. People cannot follow Varnashrama. People will not be able to surrender to Krishna also. So then Ramanandrai suggested the process. Very very powerful process. So there were a few other things in between. Those also got rejected. And then finally Ramanandrai suggested the process which Lord Brahma mentions in 10th Canto of Shrimad Bhagavatam the process of knowing God. So we are trying to understand God. We are so tiny, we cannot understand planet next to us. We cannot understand this body nicely. How shall we understand God? So we should not try to become very impudent. Can a dog ever understand about human beings, our sciences, our governance systems and XYZ? Dog can never understand our level of activities and cannot understand bacteria. Cannot understand. So how we can understand God and other things? The first living entity Brahma, who is having lifetimes of 330 trillion years and whose intelligence is also trillion times better than us trillions times better than us. Brahma also could not understand Krishna. He also mistook Krishna as an ordinary man. So we should understand what is God. So many brahmas. And when Brahma thought oh I am Brahma. I am the topmost person of the universe krishna immediately called so many Brahmas. And these Brahmas were governing much bigger universes and they were so huge. So our Brahma of our universe he was feeling like an ant in the presence of elephant. So just imagine our Brahma is so huge he appears on a lotus flower and in the stem of the lotus flower all the constellations, all the planetary systems are lying. And Brahma appears on top of lotus planet. And this Brahma appeared like an ant in front of other Brahmas who were like elephants. And like this innumerable Brahmas appeared immediately on being summoned by Krishna. So what is Krishna? So where is the capacity of us to understand Krishna, of ours to understand Krishna? So thus Lord Brahma mentioned this very nice process. And what is that? Jnana Prayasam udapasya namanta eva jivanti San Mukaritam Bhavadiyam JNA Prayasam udapasya namanta eva become very humble and Jnana prayas this mental speculation you want to understand God using your mind? Give up. I tried to understand Krishna using my intelligence. I was thoroughly mistaken. So then what is the process of understanding Krishna? Stana sita. Shruti Gatam Tanuan manobhir ye prayaso. JIT jitwapi tri lokiyam. So wherever you are you can situate yourself in that place. There is no need to change the occupation. So whatever job we are doing, whatever business duties we are doing wherever we are living, we can continue in that situation. Arjuna did not change his situation. He continued in his van ashram and his duties. But what is required is very important factor. Yes we should stay wherever we are. But Tanu wang Manobhi tanu means body, Wak means speech and Manaha means mind. Namanta Eva one should be completely surrendered to Krishna through body. Body should carry out the instructions of Krishna and speech also and mind also. So our mind, body and speech. That is why the Vaishnava Sanyasis they hold this Tridanda mind, body and speech surrender to Krishna. So mind, body and speech should be surrendered to Krishna. And then same process. What is mentioned here shrutva nebhya upasate others who do not have any idea of spiritual knowledge. They also simply by hearing from authorities can make their life perfect. Nrityam shruti parayanaha those who are inclined to hear. So this is the process. Then chaitanyamapara appreciated. Yes this is fact. This is nice process. So wherever we are we should try to surrender to Krishna completely. Without surrendering. There is no question of asking any questions and expecting responses. Unless there is surrender, spiritual knowledge is not revealed. So we have to surrender. We have to with our mind, body and speech. And then we should be very very inquisitive to understand what is spiritual life. And then spiritual life is revealed. Ye prayaso JIT jitoapitra Lokiyam then a person who is almost not conquerable so Krishna is almost not conquerable. Why almost? God should be always unconquerable. No, krishna is conquered by the devotees. Krishna becomes subservient to his devotees out of his love for his devotees. So such a person is also conquered. He is also captured out of the love of the devotees. So he'll become captured by this process of Shruti. Just see, simply hearing is so powerful. And hearing does not mean actually intellectually understanding. A person can be less intelligent. Lecture can be going on in other language. But simply by hearing what happens krishna is seated in the heart. Shanvatam sokatha Krishna punya shamanakir Tanaha so simply by hearing we are accumulating punya in our life. And when this punya spiritual pious credits increase in our life then after reaching certain balance, just like we increase our bank balance, spiritual life is revealed to us. So Krishna is seated in the heart. As soon as we pay attention to Krishna's message, krishna in the heart becomes alert. Oh, this Jeeva is trying to understand. And then Vidhu Nauti Suhrith Satam our best friend who is seated within the heart, he cleanses it from within. He helps us to clean the dirt. To the degree we are eager, to the degree we apply ourselves to hear very very attentively with respect, with eagerness to that degree, Krishna starts cleansing our heart. So thus it does not matter whether we are able to understand the subject matter or not. With great attention we should try to read the books every day. And with great attention and respect we should try to hear Srimad Bhagavatam so we are so fortunate. Prabhupada so many books are there. Prabhupada vani all the lectures are there. So every day as much as possible we understand. We don't understand. We should simply keep on hearing, hearing, hearing, hearing and Krishna will clean our heart to that proportion as a best friend who is seated within. And when the heart is cleansed, then we will start understanding everything. All the understanding would be revealed. Who am I? Who is God? Which are the two GNAS? Where does God live? How to stop this process of repeated birth and death? Simply by hearing, understanding will come and everything would be revealed. So we should simply keep on hearing with respect and attention. These are the words of Krishna. Krishna's words are non different from Krishna, from the spiritual master I am associating with spiritual master and Krishna. So even though we may be very very unqualified, we might not have any spiritual assets, our spiritual life can become perfect. This is a process given by Lord Brahma. This is a process recommended by Lord Krishna to the people of Kalyuga. This age like us who are least qualified, we can also become perfect. And then what shall we realize? All those things which are not visible to us. The actual reality, we'll start seeing that. And what is that reality that is mentioned here? Yawa Sanjaya Tekinche Satvam Stavara Jangamam Shetra shetragyasan yoga Tadvadhe Bharatarashabha O Chief of the Bharatas whatever you see in existence, both moving and unmoving is only the combination of the field of activities and the knower of the field. So now we think either there is only matter in this world existing or when we advance little, we think oh, here there is spirit and here there is no spirit. In human being, there is spirit, in plants there is no spirit. But gradually JC was proved plants also have life, they also have got spirit. So we understood, okay, plants have spirit. But here Lord Krishna is telling no sir, please do not depend upon your vision. Oh, plants are not talking, walking. So plants do not have spirit. No. So just like we are able to understand plants as spirit, we might not be able to understand, but we should take it from the authority. If a person is silently sitting in his house not opening the door, it does not mean is present in the house, he is not responding, either he's sleeping or unconscious. But the person is present. In a similar fashion, Lord Krishna is telling the soul is present everywhere. And in second chapter also we have seen sarvagata soul is all pervading. All pervading means throughout the world, souls are present everywhere. Yavasanjayata Kenchit so whatever you see in the existence both moving and unmoving. So human beings are moving, reptiles are moving and fishes, birds are moving. And then there are trees and plants who do not move. There are mountains and hills who do not move. But they are also life form. That is also a species which is having a very very long lifespan. So Stavar and Jangamam Krishna has mentioned Stavar means not moving. And Jungamam, whatever you see in this world, it is moving or not moving. Everything is combination of two things. And what is that field of activities? Shetra and Noah of the field. So this world is nothing but combination of matter and spirit. But somewhere the consciousness is very low. Just like a person is lying unconscious within the house, you call knock the door, he will not respond unconscious. So they don't display symptoms of life. Just like a patient in coma may not display symptoms of life, but they are living in a similar fashion. We don't see symptoms of life as we will see or we have seen already in this chapter that symptoms of life we have seen already. Symptoms of life are also because of the shetra that we have. Sometimes the shetra will produce animation and we will see the symptoms of life. Sometimes we will not see symptoms of life, but symptoms do not signify reality. COVID virus we can have in our body. Sometimes we will have symptoms, sometimes we'll be silent carriers. Symptoms may not be there. So why do we depend so much upon our false instruments? False seeing, false hearing we are defective having four defects. Whatever instruments we have that also is defective. So we should take knowledge from God directly. So thus God is telling whatever you see around you, you should see like this there is spirit and matter mixed. There is nothing else everywhere even within the atom spirit soul is present within the stone. Spirit soul is present within mountain spirit soul is present everywhere. It's combination of Shetra and Gyanjasi there are spirits everywhere. And how rare it is to get a human form everywhere there is spirit soul and in this human form only an intelligent human form. We can understand Krishna consciousness. So we should not waste this life. It is a very everywhere. Spirit souls are there in table, in bed, in court, in ceiling everywhere. So how fortunate we are to get this human form of life. And then Lord Krishna tells so you should start seeing everything as combination of matter and spirit. And then samam sarveshu Bhuteshu tishtantam Parameshwaram vinayasyantam YAF Pashyati Sapashyati one who sees the super soul accompanying the individual soul in all bodies and who understands that neither the soul nor the supersol is ever destroyed actually sees. So samam sarveshu Bhuteshu tishtantam Parameshwaram so this parameshwar sometimes is used for the soul also and sometimes it is used for the super soul also. So we are the controllers of this body and we are transcendental. We are param. And Parameshwara also means the supreme controller. So ishvara who is transcendental or the supreme controller. This word signifies both but seeing soul and SuperSoul within the body this word can be equally applied to both soul and supersol. So one who sees the supersol accompanying the individual soul in all the bodies and who understands neither the soul nor the supersol is ever destroyed actually sees. Now what we see is oh my father is dead, mother is dead, friend is dead, that person is dead. So nobody is dead. This death is illusion. So one who sees that the spirit soul is eternal and the super soul is also eternal they never die. Such a person actually sees. This is knowledge not the bodily concept of somebody is dying. No traveler was there. He has moved on. He has passed on. So such a person actually sees not the person who is seeing the bodies. Samam Pashan, hisarvatra Samavastitamishwaram Nahinasti atmanat manam Tatoyati param gaTim one who sees the super soul in every living being and equal everywhere does not degrade himself by his mind. Thus he approaches a transcendental destination. So what is the meaning of degradation mentioned here? So spirit soul can be either on the spiritual platform or it can be on the mental platform or on the gross platform. So when we are not able to see the super soul present everywhere in all the bodies, then we misidentify and we give gradations to the body. Oh, this is a beautiful person. This is ugly person. And, oh, he's so fortunate he is unfortunate and this is animal I should kick this animal oh these are my family members I should love and protect them so all these illusions when they are created basis the bodies that we acquire then that is degradation. Then a person has fallen on the Gross platform, then it is very, very dangerous. Now, on this Gross platform, he will find few things of his dislike, few things he will develop liking towards and thus, he will break all the laws of nature to acquire the things which suit his mind and body and thus breaking those laws of nature he will continue suffering here. Repeated birth and death here. So? Thus, degradation means falling on the platform of this gross reality or subtle reality. Whatever we perceive here on the intellectual platform, mental platform or gross platform, this is degradation. We should always try to remain fixed on the spiritual platform. But if we are not able to see the spirit souls which are there in the heart. Every body is just like we are having different vehicles on the road. So some we see sometimes a truck, we see sometimes an auto. And we shout also Oto, please give me side but we know that that is not actually auto although we are calling Oto as a matter of practical conversation but we understand he is also the same human being as myself. There is no difference. He is human being having two hands and legs. I am also having human beings having two hands and legs. But somebody is there in an auto body. Somebody's there in truck body. Somebody's on a two wheeler body, somebody is in a car body, and we identify themselves by their external bodies only. But this is illusion. If you think, oh, that person is truck, oh, this is an auto species and truck so there's illusion and misidentifying. Oh, I am Honda City. This is also Honda City next to me. So we are brothers or sisters. So this is illusion. So thus understanding. Few are my family members. Few are not my family. Members understanding. These are my enemies. I should hate them. Kill them. These are my family members. I should love them. This is dog. This is cat. Seeing different identities, this is illusion. So one should understand. Just like NATO. Natyadharo Yata just like on the stage we see somebody could be having dress of a monkey. Ram Leela you see, many human beings will dress themselves like monkey somebody would dress themselves like a bear somebody different animals but we understand there are no animals there. They are all human beings. There is only drama. We should not identify with the dress. Thus we should rise above this concept. Father, mother, family, nation, enemy, friend, criticism blasphemy praise, rich, poor, so all these things are illusion. Temporary designations of the body. We should see the real identity. We should not see this dress. Stop identifying with the dress. And then we are on spiritual platform. These are only dresses. Actually as spirit soul we are all one. We are same and we are all servants of Krishna. So. Samam pashyani sarvatra. So in this way when we offer respect all respect to all living entities at all times. Because super soul I have to see within the heart. As soon as I see any living entity I see the super soul situated within the heart. And thus this body is a temple. I should offer respect to all living entities at all times. But yes, as a matter of practical behavior if there is truck in front of me, I am there on a bicycle. I have to give way to truck that has got a bigger size. I cannot challenge the truck. You move. I will not move. In a similar fashion some bodies could be having good position, good strength in this world. And we have to behave accordingly. Some body snake body we cannot go and embrace. Oh, you are my brother. But no, that body now it is poisonous. It will kill our body. So we should understand. I am not the auto. I am not the car. But still auto has got certain functionality. Car has got certain functionality. We have to use auto and car to reach our destination. Truck is there and the person is drunk. He will hit me. I will not be able to reach my destination. Save yourself from such a truck. So just many envious species are there who will kill us. Tiger will come and kill us, swallow us. So although at heart we have respect for the tiger but as a matter of fact we will keep distance. We will not go and embrace the tiger. So behavior is as per the body. But the vision is as per the spirit soul. So thus this is very very important. We should stop seeing these identities. Yes. As a matter of duty people want to enjoy this illusory drama. So Krishna has created such laws here. And we should try to follow those laws as long as we are in this material world. But just like a person who does a drama just like we do different roles in our office that is not our permanent role. We are there having some designation in this office. We change company. We can have a different activity, different designation. Then we'll start behaving according to that designation there somebody would be my boss. I will start respecting him. Some of my subordinate can become my boss. I have to respect that person. We respect designation. So in a similar fashion in this material world behavior is as per the designation as per the body. The elderly people, father, mother have to be given respect. The family members have to be given affection. And all these things will go on exactly like any materialist does. But materialist does in ignorance. He does not see the invisible reality. He does not see the reality the soul SuperSoul within. He sees the illusory dresses. So activities may remain the same but the vision is completely different. We don't identify with different individualities. We don't discriminate friend, enemy minds, other everybody's part and parcel of Krishna. We are all brothers. We are all related to each other. So then a person does not fall to material platform. Then a person will not feel attraction and repulsion when he's perfectly situated on spiritual platform. So thus it's told on the spiritual platform Thawar dek jangam dekh nade murthy pure devotee does not see these external forms. Thawar deke jangam dekh movable or immovable he only sees Krishna everywhere. He does not see anything other than Krishna. This is the vision of pure devotee. He's always seeing absolute truth reality. So even though we cannot perceive now the soul and the super soul but simply by hearing from the authorities we should try to understand. Just like we don't see COVID virus but we hear from authorities a person is coughing having such symptoms maintain distance. So in that way we see coronavirus simply by hearing from authorities. So in this way simply by hearing I should offer respect to everybody even though I may not be seeing the super soul. So this is very very important verse. In this way we can maintain spiritual platform. And if we come to material platform hate and love and affection then we start acting as per the modes of nature. And what will happen? Prakratiyaiva Chakramani, Kriyamani Sarvasha, YAF Pashati, Tata Manam, Akataram, Sapashyati one who can see that all the activities are performed by the body which is created of material nature and sees that the self does nothing, actually sees. Now people are very proud. Yes, I have constructed this building. I have made this company. I have helped so many people find employment. I have changed the face of this country. And so many things people are proud of. But a person who is in knowledge knows self does nothing. All these things are happening as per the bodies that we acquire. Somebody is having the body of JCB. He can shift loads and rocks and mountains can change the surface of the earth. Because JCB machine is very powerful. So thus some people have very powerful bodies basis their past karma. So all the happiness and distress that we acquire in this body we'll be forced to do those activities. Pleasure of mating we will get as soon as we get body and the nature of this mind and bodies will be forced to do that activity. Nature will force us. And then the pain of delivering a child that also will be forced to undergo basis the body which we have acquired. So these are just crude examples of some happiness and distress. So like this all the happiness and distress that we have in the life that is fixed as per the activities of previous life. We cannot change that. So we'll be forced to do those activities. Pleasure of eating is fixed now hunger will come. We'll be forced to eat. Then stress of job is fixed. To earn that food we will be forced to do certain kind of job and stress will also come to us. So in this way helplessly living entity is seated and material nature is forcing helplessly. It is being forced simply witnessing happiness and distress. So although human form of life are happiness and distress is again fixed like animals. But there is one concession that we can choose. We have little freedom not to act as per the dictations of the material nature. If we take shelter of Krishna, take the shelter of Dharmena but Dharmena Hina Pashubi Samana then we are like animals. So if we regulate ourselves using the instructions of God take shelter of pure devotee. The more we become sattvic the more we become free from this helplessly being carried away by the forces of material nature. So this is actual vision. We are just like puppets. Puppeteer, Mother Durga. She is controlling us by Satvaguna, rajoguna and Tamagona. And sometimes we are very peaceful. We are benevolent helping others. Next life we can become animals. Then we can become a cruel human being. We are harming others like this. We sometimes go to hell, sometimes go to heaven. Helplessly we are witnessing this material world. But what is actual vision? Seeing those invisible threads satvagona, rajoguna, Tamagona soul does nothing. The body is doing everything. We are being forced to act as per the inclinations of the body in human form of life. You try to resist the forces of the bodies by being situated on spiritual platform. By constantly chanting Hare Krishna Mahamantra and keep on hearing the instructions of Krishna. So thus this hearing process is specifically recommended by Krishna here for people like us to see this invisible reality and not degrade ourselves on the material platform of helplessness and repeated suffering of birth and death and concomitant miseries. So now we'll finish today's discussion and let us practice now this most powerful process which keeps us on the spiritual platform of hearing. We can hear the instructions of Krishna signs of God. And we can hear the names of God the Hare Krishna, Mahamantra so those who are new this process is very simple. This process will reveal everything. All these things which we are reading will be revealed to us. And that is Hare Krishna. Hare krishna krishna Krishna hare hare hare Ram hare Ram ram ram hare hare simply by offenselessly. Now when we are chanting Radha Krishna are personally present. Suppose Radha and Krishna supreme personality of Goddess and his energy they come here. We will immediately fall at their feet. We will worship them. Any powerful personality comes. We'll offer all the respects. So in this way we should not try to hurry to finish our rounds. That is an offense. Radhakrishna, please come and go quickly. No, we should worship each and every mantra. Hurry. Radharani has come. My heart is full of gratefulness. Full of love. And in that gratefulness, in that love in the begging mood hurry. As soon as I chant so we request. Please engage me in your service. Then krishna. Krishna. Please engage me in your service. Save me from this illusion. Save me from this Maya. What we are seeing around us is only illusion. I am away from the reality which is invisible to us in the conditioned state. Please save me from this Maya. Give me shelter at your lotus feet. So Hare Krishna individually I am noticing. Radharani has come. Krishna has come. Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna. With great respect, gratitude, love. We should try to chant. And then when we chant in this way being conscious of each and every word then very fast immediately after chanting we'll feel change in consciousness. We'll not feel chanting to be a drag. We'll wait for the time when will I chant again. And if we are not conscious of this then we may keep on chanting for a very, very long time. Significant change will not happen in our spiritual understanding or consciousness. So this is the backbone of spiritual life. So we should be very, very humble, very tolerant. Give all respect to others and constant gently keep on chanting. Hari Krishna. Mahamantra So. Hari Krishna. Hari krishna. Krishna. Krishna. Hari. Hari. Hari. Ram. Hari. Ram. Ram. Ram. Hari. Hari.
