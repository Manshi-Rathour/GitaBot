yeah so what what did you do on the weekend last night so it will actually I
watched this movie so how was the movie we asked you told oh it was horrible
Prabhu means whatever yeah he would call us by the name so it was horrible he
told he has no why horrible what I'm know it is such a pathetic ending poor
our mood karab ho gaya and just to again rejuvenate ourselves we had to watch two
more movies after that so this is what happens in life with us when we want
something either you do not get it then you are anxious if you get it you are
not satisfied again you are lamenting and you are worried you are
dissatisfied so that is why Krishna tells in Bhagavad-gita
so another very important quote I would like to share with you so we have
various problems in life yes the scientists are counting we are counting
so especially all the top-most scientists they are focusing on this
very important problem of the world so what is it problem yeah you have it here
yeah so you can see this on the screen so he's very famous environmental
scientist Gus Smith so he's telling I used to think that I used to think the
top environmental problems were biodiversity loss ecosystem collapse and
climate change I thought that with 30 years of good science we could address
those problems but I was wrong the top environmental problems are selfishness
greed and apathy and you and to deal with those we need a spiritual and
cultural transformation and we scientists don't know how to do that so
he's not a Hare Krishna person he's a minute scientist and he's telling like
that so to deal with those we need a spiritual and cultural transformation so
very very important and very intelligent statement he has made so why we are so
much praising a person who is going to go to Mars and take us all there that is
how he claims because we think this world is going to be destroyed why this
going world is going to be destroyed the environment is very it is becoming
unfavorable day after day and the earth this ecosystem it is on the verge of
collapse in next hundred years it may collapse anytime so that is why we have
to go to another planet so the environmental problem is the greatest
problem of the time of the current time we will not be able to survive on this
planet so he thought that with 30 years of good science we could address those
problems and then he realized the top environmental problems are not actually
the global warming or ecosystem collapse biodiversity loss and all these things
no it is not climate change not any ecosystem problem not biodiversity
problem the top problem is selfishness greed and apathy from where all these
problems have come into picture it is because of selfishness selfishness is
called calm lust tendency to enjoy independently independent of Krishna
that is called selfishness and greed and apathy apathy is also the result of
selfishness a person is so much selfish interested to satisfy his comma
self-interest that is not at all considered about the pain which he is
giving to other living entities so much mad he is to satisfy his tongue he does
not care even if I have to kill some living entities let my tongue be
satisfied very nicely so this apathy is the result of lust strong tendency to
enjoy the senses independent of Krishna so there are only two problems in this
world and those problems are lust and greed why the society so much in stress
stress is increasing every day because of increasing lust we want more and
more and my neighbor also wants more and more all of us want more and more so
that is why he is working hard I am under stress I work harder he is also
under stress hard work is increasing and stress is also increasing in the
society but basically it is coming from lust tendency to enjoy independent of
Krishna and even if you are able to get the object of satisfaction which you
think will satisfy you you are never satisfied and then what happens there is
stress there is anger with stress and anger there are more diseases built up
in the body she'll approve by the explained 90% of the diseases they are
because of mind and even modern medicine understands they call it
diseases most of the diseases are psychosomatic they have their origin in
the mind and there are many books I was speaking to brother of one devotee so
he's telling actually this is very powerful book it tells you how to
control manipulate your subconscious mind and I was having some very chronic
disease and I am able to overcome that disease now I am completely out of it
just because how to use this power of subconscious mind all the diseases also
arise from the mental level so the way does always tell that proper to 90% of
diseases so ultimately everything has got its origin in the mind and at the
time of death whatever is our situation so now also we can see the body is a
function of mind gross body depends upon the situation of mind if mind is not
in good shape you will have diseases in the body and all the problems will arise
and at the time of death Lord Krishna explains yamvamvapi smaran bhavam so
that is a crucial phase now you are going to leave this kind of body and
pick up you may pick up entirely different body that depends upon again
the state of mind at that time if at that time the mind isn't just like when
you are giving the interview for a new company for a new job at that time in
those few minutes your state of mind consciousness your performance decides
what your next job is going to be so that is why this entire life is a
preparation for death as we have discussed whatever you are doing in
life so dharma parinishthaya etavan sankhya yoga bhyam whatever process you
are following Jan malabha para punsam ante narayana smriti you have to
remember Narayan or Krishna at the time of death so if simply we cleared this
lust and greed from our heart from our life now is any one of us crying because
we could not have a Rolls Royce I do not know maybe some very rich millionaire is
also among you attending the session but such people are very less so most of us
will not be most of us why because we never had desire to have a Rolls Royce
in our life so if you do not get it there is no issue in life if I desire
for something and I do not get it then I am in a mess so that is why the real
problem is not because I'm not getting anything in life or I'm not satisfied
even after getting that thing in life no these are not the problem the problem is
this desire never ends to have more and more things in our life to satisfy
myself and this desire will continue to have unless this lust and greed is there
in the heart so science has got no solution for these things so then what
is the solution in order to remove contaminations from our gross body we
can have various things so one of the devotees he has made sanitizer UV
sanitizer so in that sanitizer you put something and the virus bacteria they
will die so people know how to purify the things purify the matter but within
that gross matter the subtle matter body can be purified you put some some
people eat some trifle are some people do pranayama some people work out by
sweat they want to purify the body various ways and means are there for
purification but within this body there is a mind and this body is produced by
that mind how to purify that I do not know I have no idea how to purify my
mind so he says after 30 years of science this is my conclusion so this
selfishness lust and greed it arises in the mind and Lord Krishna tells to
Arjuna this is the problem this forces you to do acts which you do not want to
do in life and thus you suffer so if at all my mind is completely peaceful just
like I am not disturbed whether I get Rolls Royce or I do not get Rolls Royce
similarly if I get such a state of mind where I am not in need of any matter
material thing and every material thing is temporary you will not have it so
you are anxious it will go away again you are anxious you are lamenting crying
you are in depression or you are dissatisfied even if the thing is with
you because you are spirit different from matter matter does not satisfy you
so if such a state of mind is possible where I am very happy without desiring
that thing then that is very wonderful achievement and actually I have
experience of such a state I do not desire to become president of United
Nations even if I do not become I am satisfied I do not have that desire so
in a similar fashion can I extend it to all other spheres of life also so in
order to help a living entity attain this state various ways of purification
are mentioned depending upon the level of the candidate the topmost process
which is prescribed is that of devotional service a person engages in
service of Krishna if that is not possible then he can at least use his
wisdom and he should understand philosophy try to philosophize and on
intellectual level try to understand these problems that these enjoyments are
illusory that is because of our conditioning our brainwash that has
happened so I have decided this kind of lifestyle makes me happy so that is
what Arjuna was willing to do first kind of thing devotional service is very
difficult to understand second kind that may be possible but for very very
advanced people in order to have your intelligence functioning properly you
need to have perfect control over your senses and desires and that is very
difficult to have so that is why unless somebody is a Brahmana and he has got
training nicely in the Brahmacharya ashram then finally he can take
sannyas and he can completely dedicate his life to understand what is truth
understand this is illusion and simply by philosophizing entire day reading
the Vedas trying to remain on the platform of truth Arjuna prematurely or
trying to go to that platform in order to avoid killing his relatives so
actually he was very much attached he had a lot of desires to enjoy so Arjuna
told no Krishna actually this process is better no everyone is recommended to
read Vedas and do philosophizing so let me do that now let me follow the
process of Sankhya yoga or Gyan yoga so Krishna told no not possible that is
meant for people who have no desires in life whose senses and mind are
completely purified so you are not allowed to do that so what is the
process for the other living entities so all these processes they are called
Yajnas Yajna means sacrifice in English so Yajna is the process so material
science material philosophers have got no clue how to cleanse our heart how to
get lust and greed out of our heart which is the basis of all the problems
that we are facing in the world today so the Vedas give a solution so that is why
entire Vedic culture Varnashrama dharma emphasizes very strongly on performing
the Yajnas. Yajna dana tapasuchaiva. Yajna dana and tapasuchaiva. Sacrifice penance
austerities and charity this should not be given up even in sannyas order as
long as person is there in the material world he should do these three things
always Yajna dana tapasuchaiva. So Yajna is very very important now how an ordinary person can do
Yajna generally when we think of Yajna by Yajna we think there is fire
sacrifice fire is built up and we are putting some offerings over there so yes
that is also one form of sacrifice that is called fire sacrifice however Yajna is
a very very broader term and this fire sacrifice is but a very small segment
small section of the various Yajnas that are described in the Vedas so to
understand further let us try to read today's shlokas from Bhagavad Gita what
Lord Krishna is going to recommend now to Arjuna this is the last shloka that
we discussed in the previous class today again we will see it again very
important verse please hear again carefully
yajna arthaat karmano anyatra loko yam karma bandhanaha tadartham karma kaunteya mukta sangha samachara
yajna arthaat means purpose yajna arthaat means for purpose of Yajna work done as a sacrifice for
Vishnu and as I explained in the last class the shruti mantras vedic mantras
still yajna vayi vishnu yajna means vishnu work done as a sacrifice for
Vishnu has to be performed otherwise work binds one to this material world
therefore O son of Kunti perform your prescribed duties for his satisfaction
and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage so the
purpose of activities is not to enjoy the result of the activity that Krishna
has explained before only in the buddhi yoga in previous chapter karma name
adhikaras te maa phaleshu kadachana so Krishna explained you do not have right
upon the result of your activity but you have right to do the activity why what
will happen with the result with the result you have to perform yajna you
have to sacrifice the result therefore O son of Kunti perform your prescribed
duties for his satisfaction and in that way you will always remain unattached
and free from bondage so this freedom from bondage is what is the aim of the
living entity the bondage produces all problems in our life if you have any
kind of bondage to this material world then as long as we have this material
body we are anxious or we are lamenting for the object and then because I am not
free from the desire to enjoy that object I get another body and whatever I
have actions whatever actions I have performed to get that object every
action produces some reaction now in order to bear the results of those
actions those reactions I have to take another body and as long as the spirit
soul has this material body lot of problem as we have discussed so freedom
from bondage but I'm got Chanti and I'm I am this is the aim of life so this
stage is possible when persons heart is completely cleansed of lust and greed so
that is why Lord Krishna is telling Arjuna you have to perform your work
because by doing your work you will get some result and the result or the
activities also they should be sacrificed for Vishnu and if you do not
do that then work binds one to this material world then you have to come
here again in that way you will remain unattached and free from bondage
now what is this fire sacrifice that we do Yajna that we have heard of which we
have seen so Krishna is explaining here in the beginning of the creation the
Lord of all creatures sent for generations of men and demigods along
with sacrifices for Vishnu and blessed them by saying be thou happy with this
Yajna sacrifice because its performance will bestow upon you all desirable
things is to calm adhok
the one bow at on a not a day love how I am to her but as far as how I am to her
she of param of opsy at all the demigods being pleased by sacrifices will also
please you and thus nourishing one another but as parambhava yanta ha there
will reign general prosperity for all
is time bogan he vo de va das yante yagya bhavita thair dattan a pradayabhyo
yo bhoom testena eva sah in charge of the various necessities of life the
demigods being satisfied by the performance of Yajna sacrifice supply
all necessities to man but he who enjoys these gifts without offering them
to the demigods in return is certainly a thief so a very strong word is used
here stain yo boon testena eva sah stain means thief so here Lord Krishna is
describing just like we have various affairs in a state a child cannot
understand there is transport ministry there is urban development ministry
there is education HR ministry foreign affairs and so many departments are
their defense ministry the affairs are not being managed automatically in a
similar fashion the world affairs universal affairs are not happening
automatically although a child may not be aware of the ministers may not
identify may never meet a ministers however ministers few powerful handful
entities they are responsible for arranging the state or the nation for
countless for many many living entities in a similar fashion this universe also
has various affairs we are getting sunlight without sunlight life is not
possible on the planet we are getting water without we are getting air without
water without air without fire again life is not possible and like this
minerals we are getting grains we are getting so many things we are getting so
without all these things ecosystem and balance it is not possible and if
balance is maintained very nicely for a very very long time such nice system has
been designed we study in our biology in schools ecosystem we study food chain
how nicely one living entities food for another living entity Mahabharata also
says Jeevo Jeevasya Jeevanam one living entity is food for another living entity so who
has designed this wonderful ecosystem the plants release carbon oxygen and we
release carbon dioxide in this way but as per them we are satisfying each other so
this wonderful system so here another ecosystem another very nice cycle
Chakram is being explained by Krishna just like we are using the electricity we
are using water we are using other resources we have to pay bills for that
we have to pay water bill electricity bill and various taxes because they are
going to the directors the people who manage all these departments all the
supplies if you do not give taxes then they will be short of funds they cannot
run maintain the facilities and we will be deprived of all the facilities so if
a person is able to understand God all these things are very very easy to
understand however people are so adamant they are not able to understand that
somebody has created this wonderful systems so just like this world needs
managers a state and nation need managers the managers of universal affairs they
are called devatas there is somebody who is controlling fire there's somebody who
is controlling air somebody's controlling water the rains food grains
and XYZ all the other affairs they are being strictly controlled so just as we
give taxes now we paid you bills to these departments it is not optional we
have to pay the bills we have to pay the energy electricity bill to the energy
company we have to pay various bills somebody supplying you milk every day so
in the beginning of month or at the end of month you have to pay the bills
otherwise milkman will not give you packets so you may think oh entire month
it is coming yes because you have given in the beginning of the month so in this
life or previous life you have done yeah yeah so these your necessities are being
supplied to you if you stop doing yeah yeah all the necessities it will be
curtailed so that is why we see although we are making scientific advancement
improvement the necessities of life are being taken away from us the air is
getting spoiled more and more it is getting polluted now we need air
purifiers the water table is going down and so these basic things sufficient
food is not there why all these things are happening despite scientific
advancement we have increased our knowledge but all this increase of
increase of knowledge is not helping us because Krishna is telling here in
charge of various necessities of life demigods being satisfied by the
performance of Yajna supply all necessities to man so the Vedas describe
very nicely all the necessities the prosperity material prosperity it is
being supplied by the demigods and if we don't pay the bills how can government
maintain us so that is why he told Bhavayanthu the demigods being pleased
by sacrifice will also please you you give nice if everyone who travels in
the train they start taking tickets they pay nicely their bills they don't destroy
it don't steal away the things then railways will flourish and if the
railways flourish then they will also give you more facilities nice coaches
you would like to give more money for your travel in this way both the parties
are satisfied in a similar fashion the demigods are satisfied by the
performance of Yajna and when the demigods are satisfied we are having our
material necessities we necessities and then we can offer more sacrifices in
this way the system is very nicely maintained so this Yajna is very very
important Lord Krishna is telling to Arjuna because he was trying to escape
the duties told no please do not escape the duties because he will not be able
to do Yajna and if you do not do Yajna there is no question of material
happiness and prosperity in life so material happiness and prosperity it is
because of background arrangement of God and directly carried out by the
demigods how much ever hard we may work a person cannot increase his prosperity a
person cannot increase and prosperity does not mean mean money in what was
that country African country people are having lot of money but the commodities
became so rare inflation became 1400 percent they are not able to take it so
that is why you may earn money but you will not be having food you will not be
having water you cannot have air all these things you will be deprived of so
this science people do not know and Lord Krishna is telling here all the great
philosophers nurse of truth are telling here work should be done for Yajna
without doing Yajna there is no question of material prosperity and happiness if
a person wants even Mattis now somebody asked Prabhupada but Prabhupada they
don't do Yajna in the western countries how they are having material happiness
Prabhupada told no they are not having material happiness what is material
happiness material happiness means happiness of four platforms a hard
nidra Bhay methun a hard means eating you are able to eat nicely this is called
happiness so are they able to eat nicely in the western countries no they do not
even know how to eat so that is why when Prabhupada went there and there is a
famous Stanford University lecture of Steve Jobs so it tells I would walk how
many miles seven miles or whatever just for a meal at the Hare Krishna temple
and I would love it love that meal so these people do not know how to have
various things just from one milk product we can have hundreds of sweets
just from this thing so many delicacies we can make so the Westerners were so
fond of even now when we have lectures in the Stanford other places they would
come many people just at the prasadam time when the class is over and so many
people they would come so people were very fond of prasadam they do not know
how to cook how to enjoy in India we know how to cook various things so what
they need what they know how to eat simply some bread and put some meat in
middle of bread and have some coke or something with that that's it meat bread
and coke this is their life so pleasure of eating is not there ahar and nidra
pleasure of sleep that is not there every person has to take pills to sleep
sleeplessness is so much the most developed country in our zone Singapore
so the sleeping pills are banned in the country if some of you are hearing from
the country you must be knowing because people were taking so many pills they
would die because you have to increase their dose and as we know Michael Jackson
he died because of that over dosage of sleeping pills so people are so much
disturbed what is the use of advancement so that is called the most advanced
country Singapore and people are not having sleep at night sleep is free of
cost a villager will have a very very sound sleep but we in advanced countries
after all our advancement we cannot sleep I thought oh let me have a very
nice huge bed for sleeping with so many ACs and nice false ceiling and nice
marble on the ground and then I will have very good sleep but sir what is the
use of this arrangement of in order to arrange all these things so much
anxiety you have taken that now you cannot sleep at night sleepless so this
is called mood our civilization is so foolish they do not know where is my
happiness I cannot eat nice things I'm getting late for office some what up I'll
grab and I'll somehow like pigeon is there in the pigeon hole or so many you
have seen hence being taken to slaughter house packed in a cage like this you
travel in locals buses travel to office every day horrible so where is my
happiness there is no eating pleasure I'm just running and cooking and hardly
something I'm able to have enjoy and then I get disease because the quarter
this quarters performance went down I am suffering now and because of this I get
diabetes my entire life I cannot enjoy nice dishes I get blood pressure and
entire life I cannot enjoy salt now without salt and sugar what is your life
what will you eat so this knowledge people do not have they will get
diseased and then they have to have some salad some naturopathy diet and that's
it so eating pleasure is going away sleeping pleasure is going away mating
mating pleasure is also not there because of because restraint is not it
is very important the salt principle those who do not know salt principle
please you can visit the Jiggyasa session in Jiggyasa we have discussed
art of happiness the link is there in telegram channel so salt material
enjoyment we can enjoy only in a pinch of it just like if you put little salt
in the food then your food gets taste if you apply the logic little salt is
making the food very tasty let me put 1 kg of salt no that will destroy don't
put this logic so in a similar fashion if you think a little sex is making me
happy let me enjoy it every day no sir your life will become miserable so by
the time they marry they become impotent and they take various hormones and so
many things they are trying to end indulge but they are not enjoying
because there is no restriction so without any restriction if you try to
engage in some enjoyment that will not give you satisfaction so mating pleasure
is also not there eating mating sleeping and defending fourth material
satisfaction or material enjoyment is good defense a person should feel safe
but very safety in America yes no country can put bombs through bombs on
America but the people are killing themselves there is mass killing in
America average one mass killing every day mass killing means at least four
people should be killed like that they should be hurt or killed some there is
some parameter so mass killing single individual killings we do not know how
many but on an average there is one mass killing every day for the last four
five years in America somebody will come out and shoot so they are in anxiety so
a person should be free of fear but people are so much under fear people are
getting mentally unstable almost half the people in MIT they are in the stress
great stress depression they told 44% people are depressed so there is
constant fear constant anxiety so a person should not have anxiety and
anxiety is meant for animals yes human being human life you will feel
distressed but not so much anxious so now everyone is anxious throughout the
day always we are looking at our clock I am getting late I am getting late
earlier there is no clock only they will see the Sun no Sun has come here okay
this is the time very peaceful life now we have made our life like animals
animals always anxious he will kill me she will kill me what will happen so in
this way we are all always anxious so where is material happiness a hard
nidra Bhemath on there is lot of hair there is no good a hard no good nidra
no good method so you can accumulate resources a thief can accumulate many
many resources but he can never enjoy it so it is common sense so that is why
unless a person does yagya there is no question of prosperity there is no
question of happiness material life will be miserable so if a person wants to
have a happy material life he needs to perform yagya satisfy the demigods so in
order to clean the lust and greed from the heart this process is recommended so
at least you do not enjoy everything the tendency is to enjoy everything that I
have and to enjoy something which others also have let me have everything so Lord
Krishna is using very very strong words man who enjoys these gifts which
gifts the natural resources without offering them to the demigods in return
is certainly a thief Krishna is telling we are thief why I am being
punished sir you are just like a cashier if he's keeping all the money with
himself he's a thief so in a similar fashion whatever we have in life and we
discussed also please analyze use common sense and analyze the other species
species what they produce if a tree is producing mangoes and tree tails no no
I have produced it standing here sucking water from the ground and bearing the
scorching sunlight I have produced this fruit I will not give it to you to enjoy
then what will happen to us if the grain plant else I will not give you grains I
have stood here for three four months and I produce this fruit it is a result
of my endeavor my standing here I will not give you the grains we will die
plants gel I will not give you I you cannot take my fruits you cannot take
vegetables we will die if the tree still I will not give you my wood it belongs to
me then how can we make our houses so that's we have to see all the species so
they are supplying we are taking service from them they are not enjoying all
their results but human being it is disturbing the cycle Krishna tells
further chakram this ecosystem the cycle I have maintained so that the entire
world this prosperity is maintained but human being is breaking the cycle we do
not know this thing now yajnas are practically going to end people are not
doing it so that is why towards the end of Kali Yuga there won't be any natural
resources there won't be rain there won't be water there won't be fruits
people would suffer so it is common sense when every species is not allowed
to enjoy the result of its fruits it is the fruits are meant for others but
human being we enjoy all the results of our activities that we produce but
Vedas don't tell like that our activities our results are meant to be
engaged in service of others strong man is supposed to use a strength to protect
the weak wise man is supposed to use his intelligence to guide the people who are
in ignorance who do not have the wisdom in this way by mutual cooperation the
whole world management runs nicely as then a Vasa if a person does not do
sacrifice then he's a thief and how a thief can be happy and peaceful in his
life it is not possible so in order to cure this intense greed which has made
all of us virtual thieves this yajna is recommended you please start offering it
don't enjoy everything what you are producing now a person will not offer
because we are hardcore thieves so that is why Krishna has made this nice thing
okay you want material enjoyment know this department is there to fulfill
your thing you want good health you do surya yeah you worship the Sun God you
will get very good health he is demigod for good health you have you want to
have some material resources worship goddess Durga she is in charge for that
you want to become great hero in life you worship Lord Shiva you want a nice
husband wife worship respective demigods so in this way various departments are
there so that a living entity will agree yes I'll do that because I anyway want
to enjoy material life so thus yajnas are recommended for these devatas also
different yajnas are meant for different consciousness just like different grades
of school are there so those people who are very much materially attached karma
kanda yajnas are mentioned however in these yajnas also the main predominant
enjoying personality is Krishna so Krishna is worshipped in the form of
Shaligram Shila or Narayan Shila without Narayan or Shaligram Shila no
yajna performance is successful and Lord Krishna declares also Bhokta Ram Yajna
Tapasam Bhokta Ram means the enjoyer yajna all the yajnas are enjoyed by me
alone just like if we give money to water department energy department the
directors are not going to keep the money they will give the money to the
government treasury in a similar fashion the demigods accept it to offer it to
Lord Vishnu so that is why yajna vishnu all the yajnas are meant for
satisfaction of Vishnu we are not interested in worshipping Lord Vishnu
Krishna directly so indirectly on the plea of fulfilling our material desires
we are induced to sacrifice the result at least do not become thieves in life so
thus this yajna is recommended indirectly a person is satisfying Lord
Vishnu and there are many side benefits also of this yajna process that we do
apart from fulfillment of the material necessities wonderfully Lord Krishna
mentions here
the devotees of the Lord I'm sorry the devotees of the Lord are released from
all kinds of sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice
others who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment verily eat only sin now
this is also very important shloka we tell that oh which mistake I have done
that I am suffering in life so here we can see yeh pacanti atma karanath
atma karanath means for sense enjoyment personal enjoyment pacanti prepare food
those who prepare food for their own enjoyment as we all are doing now
agham papa agham means grievous sin bunjan te te thwagham papa those people
are committing grievous very very serious sins why serious sin so there
are few sins even if a person is very very mon moral honest and careful still
he is doing gross killing inadvertently which are those gross killings first
killing is when we are taking the grains we grind them then when we are grinding
them in the mill many many small living entities get crushed so that is one kind
of killing and then when we are cooking it in the fire flames again many small
living entities are burnt that is another killing when we are chewing the
food again many living entities are dying that is also a sin when we are
drinking water juices again many living entities die because of that and when
we are cleaning the house or other places again many living entities they
are dying we are walking many living entities are dying so these kinds of sin
or suna suna means killing it is not possible to avoid and in Krishna's eye
there is no difference if a person is killing a human being now we tell you
kill him or life imprisonment if you kill animals no problem killing animals
is very necessary in some countries but Parishit Maharaj when he saw somebody
was killing the animal somebody was torturing bull cow he immediately took
a sword to kill the person so the Vedas don't discriminate whether you are
killing an animal or a human being the punishment for you is death no short
punishment because the living entities same in both the species all our sons of
Krishna the same God suppose one of Prabhupada gives example if one of your
siblings he's not very intelligent little dull-headed so can you tell father
this brother is not doing anything can I kill him so will father allow no I am
maintaining what is your problem are you nonsense so you do your own way he is my
son I'll take care of him let him be let him remain less intelligent so even
though sometimes children are invalid they are not intelligent like the
children of the sea of Microsoft but still he's maintaining them very nicely
so in a similar fashion God maintains all the living entities so you have no
right to kill however the course of this material world is that without our
knowing also killing will happen but artificial intelligence has been built
in this world you do good activity you get good results without God interfering
you do bad activities you will get bad things so thus in order to save the
living entities from this punishment five kinds of Yagya called Panchamaha
Yagya or Panchasuna Yagya are recommended minimum even if you cannot perform
other Yagyas these Yagyas should be performed which are these Yagyas so
one Yagya we saw it is for the devatas demigods because we are having material
necessities given to us we have to do that we have to satisfy them by doing
various rituals and this is there another thing is we are also obliged to
the sages because of whom we are getting perfect knowledge of the Vedas this
material knowledge is creating more troubles in our life perfect knowledge
is taking the user manual Vedic knowledge so we are obliged some sages
have given to us this knowledge so how I can fulfill their obligation fulfill
this give this tax so that is done by Swadhyaya Yagya we have to read the
Vedas we have to read the scriptures every day so it is not that it is
optional Oh Prabhu tells every time you please read every day so I am trying to
read no it is obligation if you do not do this we are not doing our duty
properly and laws of nature will not allow us to remain peacefully so
Swadhyaya Yagya it is very important every day we have to read here
scriptures then there are general living entities every living entity
contributes to the proper management even insect they act as pollinators even
plants they give us oxygen and many things so for general living entities how
do we fulfill the obligation there is a role of agrasta he has to go outside and
he has to shout three times is anybody hungry is anybody hungry is anybody
hungry and if somebody tells I'm hungry he has to invite them feed them nicely
if the food gets over he has to cook again not that he will tell kitty kebab
jaya food is less so please come tomorrow no he has to feed very nicely
and again he has to cook so in this way he has to invite the people if anybody
tells I'm hungry and the prasadam he has to offer to them and he has to offer to
all the animals also of his house he has to take care of animals like his own
children for every animal for cow for dog for cat for pigeon for all the
animals you have to give them food there's the duty of agrasta so in this
way by offering prasadam every day to them shouting out outside before taking
meals and giving all to the all animals in the house a person can fulfill the
obligation for general living entities and by doing a titi yajna anytime
anybody knocks on your door you have to receive him like a titi devo bhava like
a devata if a demigod one of these ministers who are in charge of these
affairs they come to your place how much careful we'll be with that care you have
to respect a guest a titi titi means he will not take appointment so 6 p.m. works
for you no there is not the Vedic culture suddenly people will land up on
your door and you have to receive them and worship them very nicely so just see
Vedic culture is so nice need not book any hotels you are traveling knock on
somebody's door and he will welcome you like a titi the culture was so nice so
this is what a person is supposed to do for fulfilling obligation of general
living entities not on living entities and not on human beings a titi devo bhava
this yajna he has to do pitra nam four fathers are there we are getting this
body because of them we are obliged to them so that is why we have to do pin
pin to dawn so all these various yajnas are there which a person minimum
especially the householders they have to do every day and apart from this also
the entire society's yajna so Brahmacharya is doing yajna yajna of
hearing he can hear so many subjects but he is not interested in mundane subject
matters he is only interested in hearing Vedas morning to evening he will keep on
hearing the Vedas reading the Vedas from the spiritual master and the holy
names of God in this way Brahmacharya does sacrifice of hearing Brahmacharya
does sacrifice of senses he does not do sense gratification but he's sacrificing
the enjoying tendency in a similar fashion viva is also yajna so marriages
in Vedic culture is not because people think there is love so I love you you
love me and let us marry no there is no question of love in material world we
have discussed I scratch your back you scratch my back there is a principle
here so the marriage is not to fulfill some loving relationship marriage is
also an obligation marriage is a duty which a person does in order to advance
in spiritual life grass ashram so husband and wife both are required to
perform a yajna together and in vivaha yajna a person sacrifices his tendency
of unrestricted enjoyment if there is no marriage like it happens in western
countries in Mumbai also we see many cases people live together like that so
in this way if you do not marry then what will happen then there is no
responsibility and entire life you will be looking for a partner to enjoy so
very peace of mind mine will always be disturbed looking for partner partner
partner and if there is no peace of mind how you can think of God and with
unless you think of it you are philosophically convinced where is the
question of doing bhakti engaging in a service without which life cannot be
perfect so vivaha yajna a person does marriage and if he tries to enjoy the
sensual pleasure then he has to bear the responsibility of child now he cannot
raise many children he cannot take so much responsibility so natural
restriction is there outside marriage you cannot enjoy so now a person is
peaceful mind senses are controlled so person will be satisfied in this way of
lifestyle now we see the amount of sensual pleasure which people are
enjoying today with the artificial contraceptives that is much much more the
amount of pleasure which without contraceptive a person can enjoy in the
entire life people finish that in a week but are people much much more happy than
their forefathers like that no there's only illusion senses always demand more
until your senses are useless so thus vivaha yajna it is also sacrifice you
are sacrificing tendency of unrestricted enjoyment so like this entire life is
sacrifice sacrifice sacrifice so either a person can sacrifice his tendencies
that is also called yajna yajna does not mean only lighting fire and chanting
those mantras the rituals so any kind of sacrifice is called yajna you are
raising your children very nicely that is also yajna you may produce children
and just like it is so horrible in some countries so they just leave children
in Africa they sell off their children they are so poor so very horrible
situation so raising children is also kind of yajna sacrifice so any kind of
restriction in a duty-bound manner you are doing activity that is yajna in
order to do all the yajna very very nicely we have to take shelter of the
Vedas so now how can I do all these activities I do not know that it was the
mantra yes now it is not possible that is why people are faithless now earlier
they would see they sacrifice an old animal in the Vedas and immediately
animal gets a fresh body comes out in a fresh body so people have faith oh yes
this is working and without any mastic they would ignite fire in the woods so
they would have faith oh yes this is so nice now because we do not have such
Brahmanas even if they chant mantras do this thing it would be farce it will not
have effect so thus all these ritualistic ritualistic yajna they are
not possible now neither Aditi Devo Bhava is possible he will come plunder steal
you and kill you also if you invite any person like that so all these things are
no you cannot shout out is anybody hungry so all these things are not
practical and not possible so that is why very simple thing is being told here
yajna shishtashina santomuchyante sarvikalbhisaya simply take yajna shishta
food which is offered in yajna and because Krishna is the ultimate enjoyer
of yajna food offered to Krishna prasadam so simply if we offer the food
to Krishna and take that and yajna is sankirtana prior yajanthi sumedhasa
the most intelligent people sumedhasa in Kalyug what yajna they will do sankirtan
yajna simply sacrifice your time energy in hearing the message of Krishna and
his names in chanting and singing his names and engaging your senses engaging
your intelligence resources in spreading this message to others engaging
them this is called sankirtan yajna yajna of chanting and hearing the holy
names of Lord together so the most intelligent people they in Kalyuga they
will do this yajna so it is not just for your spiritual advancement is the main
thing but even if a person wants material happiness and prosperity yajna
is important and feel a proper tells you will be surprised by the effects of this
yajna also how a person is very nicely maintained and all this a person is
never in scarcity you does this yajna and he makes spiritual advancement his
life becomes perfect so thus yajna is very very important if
you do not do yajna we are thieves and in Kalyuga how do we do yajna yajna is
sankirtana prior by engaging in sankirtan yajna and yajna shishta we have
to take otherwise you become sinful so how do we take yajna shishta by offering
food to Krishna and taking the remnants so simply by these activities a person
can become free from all the anxieties material prosperity will come and his
heart will be completely cleansed of lust and greed he will be able to
understand very clearly what is this life what is aim of life how I am
different from body what is God and then gradually you can develop devotion and
love for God and the freedom from the cycle
