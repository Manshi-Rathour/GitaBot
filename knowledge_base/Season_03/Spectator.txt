Text number 21. In the last class, we just for a recap, because some people would be
new today. In the last class, we discussed what are the activities of a liberated soul.
And the crux was externally seeing the activities of a liberated person and that of a mad man
who is highly conditioned. There is no difference. A completely liberated soul can act just
like a madman, but internally there is a vast difference of consciousness. It's like two
kinds of people. They drop out of class or they leave the class. One who are utter failures
could not do the syllabus at all. Another class who are able to successfully perform
in the test and thus they also leave the class. So both of them will not stay in the class.
In a similar fashion, the liberated souls who have crossed the material energy and a
highly conditioned soul, externally speaking, both may behave like a madman. However, liberated
soul is not attached to any kind of activity. And in some cases, like Lord Krishna has given
example Janak Maharaj and others, even though they were liberated personalities, they acted
like an ordinary person. Janak Maharaj acted like an ordinary king. So sometimes it is
required for the liberated souls also to act regularly, especially if they are in position
of leadership, so that ordinary people can take their instance and lead their life in
the same way. That is how Lord Krishna also engaged in all the Vedic rules and regulations
very, very nicely. This is explicitly being explained in the verses which we are going
to see now today. Let us see verse number 21.
Yad yad acarati sreshthas tat tat evetaro janaha. Sayat pramanam kurute lokas tat anuvartate.
Whatever action is performed by a great man, common men follow in his footsteps, and whatever
standards he sets by exemplary acts, all the world pursues.
Nameparthasthi kartavyam trishulo keshu kinchana. Na na vaaptam avaaptavyam varta eva chakarmani.
O son of Pritha, there is no work prescribed for me within all the three planetary systems,
nor am I in want of anything, nor have I need to obtain anything, and yet I am engaged in work.
For if I did not engage in work, O Parth, certainly all men would follow my path.
As the ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results, similarly the learned
may also act, but without attachment, for the sake of leading people on the right path.
So this is the version of Lord Krishna. So all of us have to do certain activity, either
material or spiritual. Some people want material benefits, pleasure of body, and another category
of people, they give up all the pleasure of body. In India, we have seen many many examples.
Srila Prabhupada was explaining on the Radhashtami lecture, how the great leaders of human civilization,
Bharat Maharaj, Gautam Buddha, all of them were born in royal kingdoms.
And even though they could have enjoyed the worldly pleasures very very nicely,
they gave up all these worldly pleasures. Now seeking pleasure is the nature of soul,
living entity. So the common sense is what is that higher pleasure for which
such great amount of worldly pleasure is also given up by many such souls.
That is called the pleasure of spiritual life. So some people, but still work has to be done,
either on material platform or on spiritual platform. You want spiritual happiness which
is unending, which is enormous, which is much much more and real as compared to
the greatest happiness on material platform which is just like a drop
against the spiritual happiness which is compared to an ocean. And that drop is also illusory,
that drop is also not real. Just like in desert you find mirage, huge body of water.
So that is huge body and illusory. Here it is drop and illusory. There is no much pleasure also,
there is little pleasure only. Morning to evening you have to work. At night you have little
enjoyment, that's it. So entire day life after life you have to work. An entire year you have
to work and then there is promotion and then there is the only pleasure that you have. Then
keep on struggling in the same rot. So there is only a drop of pleasure and the drop is also illusory.
So that is why the wise man, he decides to work for spiritual pleasure.
Wisdom can be gained either by practical experience, you go through all the material
life and then you after many many lives you will understand, oh yes I should seek for reality,
real happiness. Another thing is the wisest people they simply hear and they understand
you need not eat cyanide to realize that it is poison. Others who have eaten you can see from
their instance, there is no need for you to follow the same path. So this is called wisdom.
So those people they start working for spiritual life. However, Lord Krishna being the supreme
personality, God Himself, He has no duties, no work to perform, Lord Krishna is telling
in the previous verse.
In the three worlds, higher planets, middle planets and lower planets,
there is no work prescribed for me. Still I am engaged in work.
So because Lord Krishna is supreme personality, all the powers are under His control,
He need not work very hard to achieve something. Some people tell Lord Krishna was
a person like us but he became very very powerful, he became God by practicing some yoga.
However, if a person carefully reads and analyzes the life history of Lord Krishna
under the guidance of spiritual master, he will understand how when he was very small he was able
to kill demons like Shaktasur. Simply by the touch of his toe, a big cart, the cart is so heavy,
the cart flew up high in the air many many feet and then it fell down.
So how a small child simply by the touch of his toe can throw such a heavy cart high into the air
and then when he was crawling and crawling crawling somehow on the floor because the
mother Yashoda she was angry with Krishna and Damodar Leela happened and Lord Krishna was tied
to a mortar so that he doesn't move, doesn't create mischief. So Lord Krishna started crawling
with the heavily mortar, started pulling it and then he made very tall huge trees.
The two sons of Kubera were standing there in the form of Yama Larjan, twin Arjun trees.
The tall trees fell down and people were not able to understand how such huge trees somebody has
made them fall down. So thus even though Lord Krishna was small, Putana, such a big demoness,
Krishna was able to kill when he was very small.
So Lord Krishna did not do any kind of mystical yoga to become God, he was always God.
So thus for God there is no need to do any activity, everything happens by his energies,
many many order carriers are there. So thus when German was there
and he came to India in search of God because India is known as land of God consciousness
but then there is so much confusion also because there are so many forms people worship here,
male forms, female forms, beautiful forms, black forms, white forms, some ghastly forms, horrible
forms and human like form, animal like form, so many forms are there and they all claim that this
is the form of God so a person may get confused that how is God like. So this person also came
to India but then he told after some analysis very easily I could understand how Krishna is God
because every other temple which you visit there are so many weapons that a God is wielding and
they are supposed to be engaged in some activity somebody is holding some skull something or killing
a demon or they are engaged in some kind of activity but when you see Lord Krishna no weapon
in his hand he's simply having a flute and he's very very nicely he's standing in very relaxed
posture and sometimes in dancing postures. So this is God, God means he need not do any activity
if a person is fighting doing this thing something personally somebody has to fight
the most powerful person no his bodyguards will fight he need not do anything
so that is how he was able to understand this can be real God real God is always
busy in enjoyment he's simply playing his murli that's it
now you may argue no no but we have seen Krishna also Krishna also fighting with their demons using
his Sudarshan Chakra killing the demons no that is different expansion of Krishna not the original
that is called Lord Vasudev Krishna never leaves Vrindavan why God has to do other kind of activities
God's activities only enjoyment that is why it is told Lord Krishna never leaves Vrindavan
so that is why it is a great science Krishna tells we will see in further chapters
Lord Krishna explains my activities and my birth they are transcendental
person who is able to scientifically understand it
he also does not go undergo repeated process of birth and death he becomes liberated
so to externalize it may appear Akrura came he took Krishna and Balram out of Vrindavan to Mathura
and then they killed Kansaach, Chanur, Mushtikasur and various other demons
but that is not fact Lord Krishna he was always in Vrindavan
but earlier he was present in Vrindavan his Prakat form everyone could see him he was visible
and then Krishna was still present but in a Prakat form many other species also can be present in a
Prakat form many ghosts are there they would be present around us ordinary people will not be
able to see many devatas would be there around us ordinary people won't be able to see them
so why Lord Krishna cannot be present in invisible feature that is why mother Yashoda,
Nanmaraj all the gopis they were always feeling the presence of Krishna
so Krishna was present in invisible form in Vrindavan Krishna never leaves Vrindavan
his only activity is to enjoy with his devotees and for fighting when various demons were there
then Vasudev form Krishna has many many expansions Vasudev also is Krishna only
as powerful as Krishna there is no difference but that is not the original form to fight with the
demons Krishna expands as another form which is called Vasudev and that form 400 form having
weapons and all this it goes and fights with the demons and kills them so this is some science
about the activities of Krishna so Lord Krishna is telling because I am supreme personality
Vedas also tell there is no work to be done by the supreme personality of Godhead
automatically he need not undergo some education in school to get some knowledge
he need not undergo strict training in gym to build strong muscles and lift govardhan no
that is not required skills come automatically to him strength automatically comes to him and
knowledge also comes automatically to him the energies which produce skills strength and
knowledge they are also coming from Krishna so Krishna does not need to do any work his
his work is only enjoyment and yet I am engaged in work why I am engaged in work because
if I do not do work certainly all men would follow my path because Krishna was king he was
leader of so many people were following Krishna so if Krishna would not have done all his activities
nicely when Narad Muni came to see Krishna Krishna had 16 000 wives and every wife was having a
palace and it was a huge kingdom Dwarka so Narad Muni was once inquisitive he wanted to see
how Krishna is able to live with 16 000 queens so then he saw amazed he was amazed to see the
power of Krishna Krishna expanded himself into 16 000 forms when Krishna would come back from his
court in the evening Krishna would expand himself into 16 000 forms and enter each palace
and then in all the palaces Krishna was very nicely sometimes he was playing with his children
riding on a horse and in other palaces in other times he was doing very nicely the vedic rites
and rituals doing the morning duties doing yajnas sometimes some marriage is happening
all the rules and regulations he was following very very nicely
so as to guide the general people general populace so that is called acharya spiritual master
the spiritual masters an actual spiritual master he's completely liberated but still
prabhupada also he showed by his example prabhupada would attend the morning program
prabhupada would attend bhagavatam class which his disciples were speaking
so he would attend the class even of his disciples so every day prabhupada would attend the entire
thing he would follow the procedures very very systematically even though it could be jet lag
could be anything prabhupada would be very strict with his morning program entire routine
so that disciples can take strength and they can follow very nicely
if i ceased to work then all these worlds would be put to ruination i would also be the cause
of creating unwanted population and would thereby destroy the peace of all sentient beings
so there are proper rules and regulations which if the people follow nicely
the entire civilization would be very peaceful just like the government has laid down some
rules of traffic if you follow the rules of traffic then people are peaceful no accidents
no mishaps no loss of life or property in a similar fashion certain laws have been laid down in the
vedas especially the dasha with the sanskaras the laws of one ashrama system if you follow those
regulations very nicely then a person is very very peaceful
and the most significant contributing factor for establishing peace in society
is having the right kind of living entities brought to this planet there is a science by
which you bring life to this planet and there is a science by which the life leaves the body
so this is most important science and it is told in gargup nisha then another various places
a person who does not know the science how the soul is entering the body how the soul is leaving
the body then kripana he is called a miser miser means he does not know how to use resources
although he got a human form of life but he has wasted his life he could not understand how the
soul has to leave the body there is proper consciousness proper time under which so the
child when he's taking birth it depends upon the consciousness of the mother and father
the consciousness of the child so there is no training about consciousness how the parent
should train their consciousness so that is why when there are no rules and regulations being
followed then what happens so this example is also given so there was a very great devotee
if i am not mistaken so he was very advanced devotee
and he became a householder because he was given the responsibility he was not at all interested
in ruling the kingdom and all but lord brahma told now there is no proper ruler
so for again he gave the same example that for a liberated soul there is no reason of doing or
not doing activity so because it is required a proper ruler is required a proper ruler can
keep the people very very peaceful actually if any disturbance is there in the nation in the
country in the state disturbance up to even abnormal climatic conditions if there is too
much cold too much rain or too much heat in the country then the king is responsible or the
government is responsible if the king is proper then the vedas mention in this month of the year
there should be rainfall if there is rainfall at that time that means the king is very pious
so there should not be even extreme heat and cold and rain everything should be very proper
there would be no unnatural deaths in the country
and the son cannot die before the father so once lord i think it was in lord ramchandra's time
or maraj yudhishthira's time so both were very idle situations how a king should lead people were
very very peaceful there were no diseases as we understand from bhagavatam even death was not
compulsory even only those people who want to die shall die otherwise death also will be very
will not touch people this is called ramaraj if the leader is very very ideal there would be no
cause because there are some laws because we are breaking the laws so we are suffering
and if the king is ideal he is in knowledge of those laws he would implement the laws
and if people follow they would be very very happy so this is called a ramaraj
maraj yudhishthir maraj parikshit during their time also the civilization was very very peaceful
so this person approaches lord ramchandra and he tells that what kind of rule are you having
my son has died before me it is there is some fault in your kingdom so just imagine even son
cannot die before father father has come first so father has to go first natural sequence has to be
followed so civilization becomes so peaceful if rules and regulations are being followed nicely
so all these things are not known now so this king
privyat maharaj he accepted to rule the kingdom and then he got a son and bhagavatam described
that son performed various yajnas to go to heavenly planets now one may ask why he performed yajnas
to go to heavenly planet he should have done yajnas for satisfaction of krishna so that he
can get liberated he can go back to krishna why he has done yajnas for satisfaction of krishna
why he had the desire of going to heaven and enjoying higher pleasures so it is told very
nice science so when privyat maharaj was conceiving this child particular child then he got carried
away by the mode of passion by lust so such a person took birth so just see even an advanced
devotee if he's not careful at the time of conceiving child a soul with lesser consciousness would take
birth as we discussed in food yoga
two sessions before how when a person is cooking the food his consciousness is getting invested
in the food and we will take up the same consciousness if we eat the food cooked by such a person
so this is the science of bhagavad-gita we are all studying matter matter matter so matter does
matter but as they say spirit matters the most you study matter it is nice so long as matter is
facilitating the happiness of spirit because you are spirit and if you only study matter and leave
the science of ourselves that is spiritual science then life is waste all the sciences will not be
all the sciences will not be able to help a person
because we are missing this most important domain of science so that is why there is no happiness
in society so this bhagavad-gita all the vedas especially the conclusive portion of the vedas
the upanishads they have this knowledge of spiritual science the science of consciousness
so here lord krishna describes when you cook food this consciousness is going there it is
getting transferred when you conceive a child similar consciousness so this is called science
of consciousness how the consciousness enters similarly yogis they are able to elongate their
life why they want to see more movies new release they want to see oh let me see this movie and die
no the yogis understand there is a proper time for leaving the body there is proper consciousness
for leaving the body if at the time of death i am having some attachment i am having attachment to
my pet dog then i will have the body of a pet dog this is the this is the law of nature just like
at the time of interview if you are not able to crack a code or speak properly then you will fail
you will not get a job you might be an expert coder or expert person expert in your subject
but at time of interview if you fail then there is no job for you sir your entire education is
waste similarly it is told in the vedas
this is the greatest benefit a person can have in life by rigorous practice of spiritual life
at the time of his death was thinking of deer thus he had to take the body of deer
so somehow or the other if a person is able to perform at the time of interview job is done
somehow or the other and this somehow needs great preparation if under great pressure in
interview situation you have to speak nicely you have to practice so much thus at the time of death
situation is very very bad all the elements internal elements are disturbed temperature
could be very high there could be a lot of pain so at that time if a person has to remember god
so at that time if a person has to remember god the lord of practice is required entire life
that is why there is great king king kula shekhar we have heard in our history of the
kings chollas cheras pandyas rastrakutas so he was one of the great cheera kings
king kula shekhar and a pure devotee of krishna so he has written mukundamala stotra very nice
prayers so in that he's praying to krishna
so krishna now my body is fit and my mind is completely absorbed in your lotus feet so let me
leave the body now only because at the time of death when with the three elements of body are
disturbed my neck is choked i will not be able to chant your name then my life would be
waste so my life is fit so just see this king knows the laws of nature so that is why he's
telling now my body is fit i am able to constantly think of your lotus feet so let the death happen
now only so there is a great science how to bring consciousness and how the consciousness leaves the
body that is why yogis would elongate their lifespan they know this science also that your
time of death is not fixed but your breathing cycles are fixed that is why the athletes they
die soon their average lifespan is less we think athletes are very fit they should have a long life
no they die soon because they breathe very heavily they consume their breathing cycles early so yogis
what do they do they practice the art of merging the inhaling air in the exhaling air and thus
they elongate their breath and they would wait just for the right time when their consciousness
is completely absorbed to the planet where they want to go or if they have become devotees when
their consciousness is completely absorbed in krishna then they would raise soul to the top
of the head and then they would leave the body they can choose their parents their time of birth
their planet of birth if they want to go to spiritual world that also they can choose
so this is how yogis they control their time of leaving this planet so these are the most
significant times when the soul comes and when the soul leaves so when the rules and regulations
are not being followed just like privyat maharaj an advanced devotee but at that time he got carried
away by lust thus that son which came out he was not having spiritual desires and if a person is
not having spiritual desires such people create disturbance in the society so thus krishna is
telling i would be the cause of creating such unwanted population and i would thereby destroy
the peace of all sentient beings so if a wrong population comes if recruitment is wrong you
cannot give training to anybody a suitable candidate can be trained so not everybody can
be made peaceful but yes our krishna consciousness is so nice we need not consider whomever you meet
just request them please chant harry krishna mahamantra because this harry krishna mahamantra
it is non-different from krishna it is krishna's avatar only so simply if a person is chanting this
harry krishna mahamantra krishna is all powerful entire mind body will change does not matter
everything will change so this is exceptional circumstance if a person comes in contact with
the holy name of krishna otherwise by following the regular vedic process
such unwanted population cannot be trained and thus nobody can save the world from being
disturbed perpetually so these are the great sciences simply by ruling properly as per the
laws of nature everyone can be peaceful so krishna ruled properly and did all the vedic rituals
nicely so that people can take his instance and lead the life accordingly in his footsteps
so that is why lord krishna tells to arjuna
as the ignorant perform their duties now there are two classes ignorant class and the intelligent
class so what is the difference between the difference between the two classes there is
lot of competition and argument one party is telling this other party's fool they have wrong
policies they do not know how to take the nation forward another party is accusing the first party
they do not know their policies were bad what have they done so far but ultimately whichever
party rules people are dissatisfied and they are bound to change the government people have never
become satisfied by one government they keep on changing and still they don't have sense that
none of the governments are working what should i do now what are they missing
so how to understand who is wise who is ignorant so let us take the version of lord krishna the
version of all the most intelligent people who take bhagavad-gita as authority here it is mentioned
how we can understand the litmus test who is foolish and who is intelligent so krishna tells
ignorant perform their duties with attachment to results similarly the learned may also act
but without attachment for the sake of leading people on the right path
so you are studying very very nicely why you are studying so much you are attached to your grades
your rank your marks then foolish if i'm studying very nicely because i'm attached i get disturbed
if i do not get good marks i get disturbed i do not get good rank then we are to be considered
foolish if i am working very nicely because i am attached to the result attached to the money
which i am going to earn then foolish if i am not attached to that money then yes then i am
wise i am acting just so that i can lead the people on the right path what is the right path
you engage the results of your activities in the service of krishna
so only the ignorant people are attached to the result and this material world is
paradise of the ignorant people fool's paradise everyone is being trained no no only when you
the result of your activity only are going to satisfy you no sir result does not satisfy
the activity itself satisfies you when the activity is done for the pleasure of krishna
and we also can understand when the when two people are in love it is not that they are doing
some activity so that the result of activity will be satisfying no simply when they engage
in the loving service for the beloved the heart is full of love so the same activity only it
becomes full of pleasure full of ecstasy when the activity is done for our eternal relative the
supreme lord and a person who does not have this knowledge they are attached to the results they
want to directly enjoy the results and thus they are called ignorant and such an ignorant man does
not know what is the ultimate aim of life for which work should be done that is why krishna
tells
Arjun some people will not be able to understand they would think
i am meant to enjoy the results of my activities when i get money i get name fame or marks i will
be happy but please understand our happiness is not at all connected with the results our activities
are only connected to our consciousness when i'm acting without attaching myself to the results
then i can be happy when i offer the results to krishna then i will be happy if i am simply
just giving up results i will be peaceful happiness is possible happiness is positive state
when i am not attached to the results i just give up the results for a good cause i will be
peaceful at least and if i give to the right cause the topmost cause krishna then i am happy
so it is not easy to understand this that is why krishna is telling let not the wise disrupt the
mind of the ignorant who are attached to fruitive action they should not be encouraged to refrain
from work but to engage in the work in spirit of devotion if you tell somebody no give up all works
and just completely engage yourself in the service of krishna it is not easy to understand
it is not easy to understand oh i have not seen krishna i have not seen this thing how you are
telling so it is not possible after great spiritual advancement person can realize so that is why for
them those who cannot think anything else higher subject matters you should not discourage them
from doing their work simply let them engage in work and offer the result of their work to krishna
this is how people should be educated so arjun was willing to give up for krishna told no please
don't set this instance another symptom of ignorant man is given here
very important shloka which we are shared in the creative also
so
all being done everything is being done by the material nature the bewildered spirit soul
ahankar vimud atma under the influence of three modes of material nature
thinks himself to be the doer of activities which are in actuality carried out by nature
now this is very important shloka few words are important first important word is bewildered spirit
soul so we are the consciousness present in this body and ordinarily the spirit soul is bewildered
bewildered means confused cannot understand what is right what is wrong cannot understand what is
truth and what is false bewildered under the influence of three modes of material nature
why the spirit soul is bewildered because it is under the influence of three modes of material nature
here
just like when a person drinks he becomes bewildered he is not able to understand
where is road where is footpath where is my house how should i enter where is the
button he cannot understand because he's bewildered by the influence of let's say some drugs some
alcohol chloroform these substances have some influence upon us and then a person gets bewildered
so it is told here the spirit soul it is bewildered because of the influence of three modes of material
nature and then what is the effect of such bewilderment such spirit soul thinks himself
to be the doer of activities the spirit soul thinks so i am doing this activity just like a
person who is drunk he imagines something else a madman as we discussed the other day in the
a madman as we discussed the other day in the previous class the madman standing at
the traffic junction he's thinking i am controlling the traffic and very sincerely
is trying to indicate the cars to stop and move on and turn like that he's thinking he's
controlling the traffic but he's a madman in a similar fashion only under madness living entity
thinks i am doing something here actually all the activities are carried out by nature
so how do we understand this verse
nothing is in my hands i'm completely helpless just a spectator i am watching and automatically
my hand is moving my legs are moving and then i'm turning left i'm turning right suddenly i'm eating
something and then sometimes i'm diseased sometimes i'm fit i'm completely under control
i'm talking like this to this person am i being completely controlled to talk like that
i am sitting someplace i'm being forced to sit there in that place what does it mean
i am not the doer at all everything is being done by nature and if that is so what is the
use of giving lecture and hearing lecture and why a living entity is being put into hell and heaven
if everything is being done by nature then nature force me to do wrong activities why you are making
me suffer why you are punishing me or why you are rewarding me then how do we understand the laws
of karma why a living entity gets bad reaction for doing bad activity and good reaction for doing
good activities so this appears to be contradictory and difficult to understand there is law of karma
also and the acharyas are giving instructions also if there is no free will there is no freedom
what is the use of the instruction and writing all the vedas and if there is free will how do we
understand krishna is criticizing a bewildered spirit soul thinks himself to be the doer of
activities so how to resolve this so that is why in order to liberate ourselves we need to
understand the science how this world is functioning so not just reading but study of
bhagavad-gita is required so that is why we have these rdua sessions in the evening
where the devotees read they discuss they understand more deeply and how to apply this in our life
oh prakriti kriyamani somebody can tell so everything is being done by nature let me now
helpless what is the use of anything things will happen automatically a person may think
krishna is telling so
the description is given in shreemad bhagavatam so i will share again now
yeah
so i hope you are able to see the screen now
3.27.19 so here it is mentioned very nice shloka it is from third canto of bhagavatam
kapil muni is explaining to his mother
so mother is asking hence even though he is the passive performer of all activities
how can there be freedom for the soul as long as material nature acts on him and binds him
this i'll explain some other time why in what is the context but we can see the purport
although the living entity desires freedom from the contamination of matter
he is not given release actually as soon as living entity puts himself under the control
of the modes of material nature his acts are influenced by the qualities of material nature
and he becomes passive it is confirmed in bhagavad gita now this shloka which we have read it is
being referred here the living entity acts according to the qualities or modes of material nature
he falsely thinks that he is acting but unfortunately he is passive in other words
he has no opportunity to get out of the control of material nature because it has already
conditioned him so this is the actual understanding the living entity yes he is acting
he is acting
but what is this action of the living entity so living entity is a passive doer passive
worker passive means i am thinking oh i am doing this activity i am going to my office
no sir you are not going to office this body is being given to you now in this body which
is filled with rajoguna and tamoguna you will never be able to understand that you are spirit
soul and thus you have a spiritual need so this rajoguna and tamoguna will make you feel you are
the body and the satisfaction of body is your satisfaction so these modes of nature will force
you to go to work every day and work very hard every day and then you will suffer from that
hard work but you cannot give up that hard work you don't want to compete like that day in and day
out every quarter every exam but you would be forced to compete why because of this these modes
rajoguna and tamoguna which make you feel that you are this body just like in dream
we are forced to feel that i am that body in the dream and i am forced to suffer from the tiger
or who is chasing me or any loss which i have in dream so thus living entity remains a passive
worker human beings can make skyscraper buildings that also material nature is forcing them to make
it is the nature of it is the plan of nature to make building now some living entity who is
having mode of passion creativity that living entity would be forced to make a building dog
it can never decide also to make a building although the dog will keep on suffering under
the reins the solution will not strike him dog will never be able to think oh these people are
able to make building who give me chapati and bread every day i can also go to school and college and
have the education dog cannot think like that dog will take his chapati run away that's it
so that's we have to understand we are helpless it is not that i have i have great choice i have
very very very limited choice passive workers this illusion is given to us and then helplessly as per
the modes of nature that we acquire we develop different faiths tamasik person will be forced to
remain dirty will be forced to procrastinate and then suffer from the result also
so thus human life is meant to increase this freedom
so many forces are there there's force to taste there is force to speak
sometimes try to remain silent entire day not possible person will speak something so very
difficult
grow the vegam and anger comes you cannot simply cut down anger silence i don't want to entertain
you you cannot do that anger will force you grow the vegam and then you will act helplessly and
then you will suffer why spoken like this to my family members why i spoke like this to my boss
to my subordinate to my neighbors and then you suffer so in this way nature harasses the living
entity it gives anger and then it forces us to act and then you suffer from the results
so but a person who is foolish he thinks i am the doer i have freedom i have chosen this business
i have chosen this job i have chosen this person no sir bewildered in bewilderment as a passive
worker so because first of all there is bewilderment about myself and then i am helplessly pushed to
choose the actions so that is why the happiness is not in enjoying the results of the activities
of the activities which we have been trained but the happiness lies in coming to sat bhaguna
this people do not know when i come out of the influence of these lower energies then i am happy
in mode of passion whatever i may do the result would be only dissatisfaction so this wonderful
science we will see in 13 14 chapter of bhagavad-gita lord krishna describes so now complete freedom is
not there little little freedom would be given now if you completely want to understand god and
immediately understand everything it is not possible immediately want to follow sadhana and
do this thing not possible little scope would be given oh i am very busy sometimes people tell
prabhu i only have half an hour in a day so that half an hour you engage in the service of krishna
so that half an hour if you spend then more freedom would be given to you half an hour more
two hours more four hours more and then time will come when you will be completely free and
then life would be successful just like a small kid he can only express his freedom to move from
his standard third standard to fourth standard he cannot jump to fifth standard or tenth standard
or to job directly but freedom is there if he does not cover even that much syllabus he will
remain in the same class and then he will be thrown out of school if he does not perform he
fails continuously so in a similar fashion if we don't exercise our freedom rightly to
follow the process spiritual life nicely then even that freedom will be taken away from us
so that is why i request all of you so now many of you have developed the habit of hearing one
lecture every day two days we are there together rest days we hear prabhu's lecture so please
continue with it we may get taste we may not get taste taste is not important tapasya is important
rajasic activity means immediate pleasure you will get and long-term misery satvik happiness
means immediate discomfort would be there but long-term happiness is there so entire life people
think let me do what gives me happiness devotee does not do like that devotee tells please tell
me what is my duty simply do the duty nicely and then long-term there will be happiness by such a
task so that is why i request you all do not consider when you follow spiritual life oh
i am not getting pleasure and this thing no so spiritual life simply think about pleasure
of krishna if i am chanting his names with a fixed commitment krishna is getting pleasure
i am getting knowledge of bhagavad gita krishna is getting pleasure
just stick to the process and then you will see you're getting more and more free
