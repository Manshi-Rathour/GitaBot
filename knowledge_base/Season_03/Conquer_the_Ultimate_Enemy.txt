Arjuna was not willing to fight and a Kshatriya is never supposed to give up
fighting even though death is assured after fight but still he's supposed to
fight why so Krishna explained the importance every person has got certain
psychology certain physiology so basis his psychology physiology some duties
are assigned in the Vedas and what is the purpose of all these duties the
purpose of all these duties is cleansing of the heart removal of the lower
energy so that a person can completely understand when he comes to Satvaguna
just like now what is the purpose of education to make a person learned
knowledgeable same thing so Vedic culture all the duties whatever we have
in Bhagavad-gita other Vedas they are meant to elevate us in knowledge but
people do not know from where do we get knowledge so this material knowledge is
not real knowledge knowledge Lord Krishna mentions the Vedas still knowledge
means understanding first of all your real position that you are different
from this body if you are always hallucinating you are somebody else like
a madman on the street who is thinking he's traffic police everything else is
a waste of time so first of all coming back to your original position realizing
who you are that is called knowledge and Vigyan means practical application of
this knowledge so in order to come to this platform of knowledge as we have
been discussing Satvaguna is required so all the rules and regulations are
meant to promote us to Satvaguna Satvik energy so Krishna told Arjuna now
you're not willing to fight but nevertheless because you have got body
of a Kshatriya naturally your psychology will urge you to engage into fighting
later even if you now become Brahmana take a nonviolent job you will not be
able to continue it you have to repress these urges which a Kshatriya has of
fighting of controlling others and what will repression accomplish so this
question is asked by many people that trouble you are telling we have to
follow these rules and regulations eat this thing do not eat this thing but I
have this urgent tendency to enjoy life in that way and if you simply repress
the urge it builds up and keeps on building and I am afraid it may blast
any day and gets blasted out sometimes and then we end up enjoying much more of
it so Krishna also told same thing the repression will accomplish nothing and
Arjuna realized yes this is fact so now Arjuna wants to understand
scientifically that Krishna please tell me what is Arjuna asking I'll explain
the translation let us read the powerful Sanskrit words first text number 36
so Arjuna asks Arjuna said oh descendant of Vrishni by what is one
impel to sinful acts even unwillingly as if engaged by force so this is the
problem with the entire world we know I do not want to do something it is not
good for me but still by force I am engaged to do certain activity I know I
have to prepare for exam but my eyes are forcing me to watch more and more videos
now what do I do my ears are forcing me to hear more and more audios what do I
do tongue is forcing me I know I am diseased I should not eat but my tongue
is forcing me eat this and I get diseased and I suffer from it I cannot
control my tongue and in this way so many ways a living entity is being
harassed by this force and Arjuna is telling even unwillingly what is this
force by what is one impel to sinful acts so Krishna gives the answer
Sri Bhagavan Vacha Kamesha Krodhesha Rajoguna Samud Bhavaha Mahashanoma
Papma Vidhi Enam Iha Vairinam the blessed Lord said it is lust only Arjuna
which is born of contact with the material modes of passion and later
transformed into wrath and which is the all devouring sinful enemy of this world
so technically in Sanskrit this force is called karma and in English it is
called lust and how it is born it is born of contact with the material modes
of passion so there are three more three energies which influence our body body
mind everything there is nothing but three energies in this world so when
living entity contacts too much of material mode of passion then it becomes
very very lusty lust arises because of passion and later it degrades into
ignorance it transforms into wrath anger when the lust is unfulfilled then a
person becomes very angry and somebody may ask so what is the problem yes I
agree I have some desires desires to eat desire to do this thing that is I am
working very hard and I'm going to office every day I do my business or do
my job or whatever and in this way and money and by money I will have all the
objects of my sense enjoyment then whatever I want to eat I'll keep on
eating and yes going office is not very pleasant thing but I'll accumulate money
I'll retire soon at the age of 40 years and then I will enjoy unlimitedly like
anything so what is the problem with this so Krishna is telling no there is
problem it is a all devouring sinful enemy of this world this lust is the
enemy of this world all devouring this lust is devouring eating up all the
living entities killing all the living entities living entities not killed by
anything but the lust only if the living entity is able to conquer lust then there
is immortality assured for the soul so this lust is all devouring so this
tendency of enjoyment it kills us and thus it is the sinful enemy and just
like enemy kills you in the battlefield or in anywhere similarly this lust is
enemy because this lust is killing us so definitely there is some pleasure
please read these purports very nicely we are not neglecting the purports
because the purports are less important they are rather most important so I'm
explaining some extracts of the purports and lectures and anyway all the purports
you will be covering in the Bhagavad-gita discussion as most of you are
already doing so please do read all these purports so Srila Prabhupada very
nicely explains so there is definitely some pleasure you may be thinking why
we are objecting please tell us how to make quick money so that I can satisfy
my senses very easily I don't have problem with this thing no so the
problem is although there is some happiness but that very happiness is
the enemy of the living entity example given is just like snake snakes body is
very cold if you wear a snake around your neck you'll have very nice cooling
feeling so very cold garland you like to have it but then you know if you know
it is snake you will throw it away why because although the touch is very
pleasant but the bite of snake is not very pleasant a person would be killed
so this is the feature moth moth is very much attracted by the fire but then the
fire has another feature which is heat and moth jumps into fire to enjoy one
feature and gets killed by another feature in a similar fashion we are
being killed by this lust although there is some happiness flickering happiness
never satisfying and ultimately it leads us to death so again some people tell
TK Prabhu marna hi to hai toh enjoy kar ke martyar kha pi ke martyar instead of
70 80 years and leading a life of great austerity you have not enjoyed anything
what is the use rather have a life full of enjoyment and dying 40 years with
cancer or whatever it happens we don't care let us enjoy the life to the full
extent and die soon dying at 40 years and having enjoyed like anything is much
better than suffering suffering tapasya tapasya and you will live 80 years 100
years how does it matter but your life is miserable and I had 40 years of
enjoyment so Lord Krishna is answering Arjuna that also Lord Krishna tills do
mana vriya te vah nir yatha darsho malena cha yathol vena vrithogarbhas tatha tene
dama vritham as fire is covered by smoke as mirror is covered by dust or as the
embryo is covered by the womb similarly the living entity is covered by
different degrees of this lust
aavritham gyanam etena gyanino nitya vairina kamarupena kaunteya dushpurena
nalena cha Lord Krishna mentions thus a man's pure consciousness is covered by
his eternal enemy so Krishna is telling God is telling this so-called lust which
you wish to satisfy and enjoy this is your eternal enemy is covered by his
eternal enemy in the form of lust which is never satisfied and which burns like
fire so this is very important to note so this logic is very long wrong logic
that let me have 40 years of complete satisfaction and enjoyment no sir
Krishna is telling it burns like fire and any attempt to satisfy the lust by
offering the objects of enjoyment is like pouring ghee into fire pouring
butter into fire fire burns even with greater light and vigor so it is never
satisfied if you are thinking you are going to get satisfaction then please
observe we are very expert in analyzing the data now data analyst job business
analyst very required positions so please do some analysis and all those who
have done analysis they are telling that all the the objects of sense
gratification and the limits and the laws everything now promotes sense
enjoyment but despite all this depression and stress is increasing in
the world so this is the proof that we are not satisfied in madness people may
speak like that that is why it is called madness noonam pramatta kurute vikarma
yad indriya prithaya apranoti shreemad bhagavata mentions noona means
definitely pramatta means madman kurute vikarma a person breaks all the laws of
nature initially tries to satisfy following the laws of nature but then
greed becomes so much industrialist is all already so rich but he breaks the
laws of nature breaks the laws of society the civil codes and thus he
becomes a criminal he is not satisfied with that money adultery and so many
things crimes we see in the society because they are not satisfied so the
more you want to indulge in the sense objects the more it results in
dissatisfaction in life so this is the problem and even before that Lord
Krishna mentions as we saw here also we can see man's pure consciousness is
covered by his eternal enemy in the form of lust without knowledge there is no
question of happiness and the knowledge gets covered by lust and what is the
knowledge their time different from this body so here Lord Krishna mentions
there are three degrees by which a living entity is covered by this lust
boom in a very active on it one thing is just like fire is covered by smoke
another covering three examples are given another example is just like the
mirror is covered by dust and embryo is covered in the womb fire covered by smoke
that covering is very shallow you can little fan the fire and fire will get
ignited like anything and all the smoke covering will be gone you can see fire
in full blaze so this covering is easy to remove dust covering the mirror it is
also relatively easy little more effort here to rub it off but very abominable
situation is that of embryo in the womb how much ever it can try it is very
tightly compactly packed in the womb so in this fashion all the living entities
within this material world so there are two worlds two creations there is one
world which we are part of now which Lord Krishna mentions we will see in the
fourth chapter also seven chapter also Lord Krishna describes this world has
got certain nature we have our bodies composed of matter and then there is
another world of which we have no idea our rockets are just hardly able to
reach moon after a month or Mars like that if at all they are able to reach
that is also doubtful and what to speak of going beyond galaxy beyond solar
systems and beyond the universe Bhagavad-gita mentions Lord Krishna
mentions there is another creation which is called which is eternal it is
transcendental it is completely made up of spiritual energy there is no matter
over there and because we are spirit souls we are compatible we are happy in
completely spiritual environment example given is just like fish in water is
satisfied fish out of water is never satisfied now we are willing to transfer
our soul from this city to another city oh this Balghar is not good let me go to
Mumbai oh Mumbai is not good let me go to New York oh now this is also not good
let us go to moon or Mars but Srila Prabhupada tells what are you going to do even if
you go to all those planets so all the living entities here on any planet they
are controlled and covered by this enemy which is called lust so this material
world is called method Niagara why a living entity is not able to go to
spirit soul it is shackled here just like the criminals are shackled in the
prison so what is the shackle we don't see any shackles on my hands and legs I
am free to move I can go anywhere what is stopping me what is putting me to
repeated birth and death in this material world so the scriptures
mention that is Matthew Agarra that is this lust only these lusty desires
force a living entity to accept bodies life after life some bodies the force
of lust is very very great that a person becomes completely dull and takes the
body of trees so that situation is compared to just like embryo in the
womb very much come covered he cannot see any light in complete darkness in
complete oblivion with the world in a similar fashion the living entity when
it is in the form of trees it is almost unconscious it cannot even move
somebody's coming to cut it harm it attack it the tree cannot run away so
that is the most that he's heavily covered by lust and then slowly when the
soul leaves the tree body so all these things are mentioned in the Padma Purana
then it takes the form of
insects then insect may take the form of not may it will take the form of
reptiles then birds then beasts four-legged beast then two legs and two
hands chimpanzee monkey orangutan and then eventually a beautiful form the
human form it will get and in human form of life it is like Dhumena Vriyate
Vahner the consciousness is very much developed there is little covering a
little covering of the lust and if the living entity decides it can completely
remove this covering and come to its original blazing position as pure
spirit soul but if it misuses the freedom it gets more conditioned like
mirror covered by dust again like embryo covered in the womb of the mother so all
these things are mentioned in the scriptures however even if it is
difficult how can I believe that we will take different bodies if I become very
lusty I'll become animal in the next life and animal life is very horrible
nature will give the facility to enjoy birds like pigeon ducks swans they enjoy
a lot of sex life around 20 times in a day human being does not have that
capacity because human body is meant for self-realization but if you want to
enjoy such kind of happiness animal body is immediately given bird body is
given but although a living entity will be able to enjoy the sex pleasure a lot
however we can see how that life is very very dangerous always scared anytime
death can happen from anywhere and some people who are very new today it may be
difficult to understand that how we are not the body so all these sessions are
there about the subject matter only we have discussed it very elaborately and
you can also visit the link that we share in our telegram channel and you
can get all the understanding so immediately it may not be possible just
like a sleeping person because some people are new today so please allow me
to speak some basic knowledge also so just like when we are sleeping a sleeping
man he is dreaming somewhere and he's thinking he's part of reality so it is
very difficult for him to get convinced this is not reality unless he wakes up a
blind person it is very difficult for us to convince there is a building or
somebody standing in front of you unless he gets eyes he will always be
doubtful unless sleeping person is woken up they will always be doubtful they
would think that this dream is reality so as long as a person is lusty he's
intoxicated he's addicted to enjoying the senses there is no possibility no
amount of logic will be able to convince that person just like any amount of
logic cannot convince a sleeping person although is putting all the logics
applying logic reasoning in the dream but as long as he's covered by mode of
ignorance Thomas he's dreaming sleeping there is no question of coming to the
platform of knowledge understanding his real position I am getting late for my
office I am not supposed to sleep and he's suffering in his real life so in a
similar fashion these things are very evident and with advancement in
Satvaguna a person can understand and if a person is little intelligent he can
immediately understand so what is this this is called meditation am I the
nails of the body no nails are changing am I the skin of the body no skin is
also changing skin can be removed I can continue and other skin can come am I
blood no blood transfusion happens am I the organs no organs can be changed am I
the eyes eyes can be changed in this way you meditate who am I I am seeing I am
watching I am thinking I am talking so who am I I am not this organ not the
blood nor the bones the bones also are replaced there is fracture they'll put
some steel rod instead of bone so all these things can be replaced who am I
then I am watching from this body I am hearing through these ears who am I
where am I sitting in this machine so this is called knowledge with little
intelligence we can understand and I do not need this body to enjoy life when
I'm dreaming dreaming I'm not using the body at all I'm enjoying on mental
platform I'm eating I'm walking I'm talking I'm interacting without this
body at all so with little intelligence with Satvaguna we'll be able to
understand all these things gradually however this logic is very very clear
even if somebody is not able to understand the soul changing different
bodies another fact is very easy to understand what is that fact
that this lust burns like fire and a person is never satisfied by this
the more you want to increase your enjoyment of senses the fire also burns
more I want more I want more and then person becomes mad the more he
enjoys the more he becomes mad and vikarma breaks the laws of nature and
then he suffers but here in this world he'll be punished if he is not punished
here anyway is going to be punished by the laws of nature yet indriya prethaya
aapranoti why a person suffers indriya prethi just for satisfying the senses so
no Prabhu let me wait it is youth I am we are very young now so the youths have
this issue this lust is very strong and with old age it will be settled so let
us enjoy now people tell that youth is very limited it will go away before it
goes away enjoy like anything this is another madness maybe because the old
people are shy to share and people are so Bhagavatam reveals everything
because the creator has perfect knowledge about the psychology and
everything so and there is very famous story also we have heard Akbar Birbal
stories so the great King Akbar he was ruling over the country and Birbal was
his very intelligent minister so the Kings would always take advice from the
Brahmanas ministers it is not that the King will take King has very good
administrative ability and Brahmanas have got very advanced intelligence so
Brahmana has got a higher business in life self-realization so he guides the
King that you engage people in their professions in such a way that Krishna
God is in center of their activities so that they also can advance towards
perfection of spiritual life and Brahmana although he is intelligent he
can rule but in normal circumstances he does not rule he does not want to waste
time in all these things he lives a very humble life very austere life and thus
he is very very happy Brahmana very very satisfied in his life because he does
not indulge in satisfying this lust satisfying the senses so Akbar Birbal
there is very famous story about it so both of them they had a lot of
discussions once discussion happened Akbar was telling that Birbal how long
will this lust remain with us and because they are Kings and they have
many many Queens and they can enjoy but then he was not satisfied anybody who
has objects of unlimited enjoyment we realize we are not satisfied by that so
he is asking Birbal how long shall we be haunted by this lust how long shall
remain in our body so Birbal told we will never get freedom from this lust it
will always be there till death so Birbal does not agree no no no how can
an old person be lusty and till death no I don't agree he told no problem I will
let you know one day and then once Birbal approaches Akbar that my Lord
please come we have to go immediately no where no please come I have we have to
go I have to show you something and while coming please call your young
daughter also but told okay he thought my minister is telling should be
something important and Akbar went along with his young daughter and Birbal told
now I'm taking to this house this person is very old and he is about to die now
all of us will go inside and you please carefully observe this old man and all
of them they enter inside and they had a chat and then Birbal came out so
Birbal told Akbar did you notice something and Akbar realized yes all the
time the king is there the most famous personality but he is not attracted
towards the king he was always constantly looking towards his young
daughter so Akbar told yes Birbal I understood so Birbal told this lust
never vanishes from the heart and many many old people they also come and
reveal the heart in the sessions Prabhu I am very much ashamed that I am such an
old man but what to do with this lust how to tackle this feeling it is still
there in my heart and Srila Prabhupada gives example especially in the Western
countries India had still little bit of culture in the 60s and early 70s
Prabhupada told in the West old man his organs are not functioning at all but still
because of this lust even though he cannot do anything with his organs but
he spent so much of money and he goes into the bar pubs and simply sees some
girls dancing over there so all the bro he is practically invalid but still this
feeling is there the body cannot satisfy that feeling but the feeling never goes
it torments even an old man so some old people think only with this this problem
is there just with me no it is with all so this lust never leaves the living
entity so a living entity is never satisfied it only keeps on increasing it
is not a good idea to think let me die early by enjoying very very nicely no
we'll only suffer so another very striking example which is mentioned in
Bhagavatam is it is compared to itching propensity we have discussed many times
eczema patient he has many sores on his body and the whole body demands please
scratch it scratch it all the sores they demand a lot of itching is there you
feel like scratching entire day but then the doctor still please do not do it
because the more you scratch it the itching increases and ultimately blood
starts coming out so this entire civilization what we have built today the
wonderful schooling system CBSE ICSC International Board Cambridge and the
big international universities the big institutes of technology or of sciences
and arts what are we doing ultimately we are doing nothing we are teaching them
how to rub this wound rub this source on your body the senses are having this
tremendous itch and how to satisfy your itch the entire civilization is nothing
but you can scratch it with your hand no you scratch it with you with this nice
brush with nice tools all these tools all this advancement which is built
around us it is how to scratch the it how to scratch the wound better how to
scratch that wet sore better and the itching only increases
scratching is the aim of life we have scratched in India now we will scratch in the US
now let us go to Mars what will we do in Mars we will scratch
we will be simply scratching that's it keep on scratching like monkeys so is it
very high kind of enjoyment yes definitely there is some pleasure if you
call it whenever there is some itch after rubbing it off after scratching you feel
some happiness you are relieved from that but is that very high kind of
happiness does a person tell oh I'm feeling so great no so that is a
Prahlad Maharaj tells a person is never satisfied by this
he undergoes great miseries by this and thus the data the analysis the
world our experience is the proof in our life so this civilization is that is why
dull civilization because civilization is very lusty their knowledge is covered
this very simple fact which a child also if given proper education can
understand but because of this lust we are so much mad after satisfying the
senses we are not willing to listen this knowledge not willing to understand
consciously or subconsciously but this is the entire civilization technology
means have more advanced gadgets simply to scratch it that's it so this is not
going to help us crazy civilization so what is the solution need not get
depressed although this problem is very tough and difficult but the solution is
also given by God what is the solution let us now go towards it so Krishna
mentions if we have to defeat enemy we need to know where is enemy sitting in
Kargil war it was very difficult to spot out where the enemy is they were hiding
high in the mountains it was very difficult for the soldiers of India to
first of all where they are so they figured it out with difficulty and then
it was easy to root them out so we have to figure out this energy where is it
sitting in the body then I could tackle its influence so Krishna is telling the
senses in the Rani mana her mind both he and intelligence are the sitting places
of this lust which wheels means covers the real knowledge of the living entity
and bewilders him so just like the virus when it enters the body it bewilders
person starts reeling he feels the world is going round although the world is not
spinning it is because of this effect virus he's feeling the whole world is
going round and all food is bitter no it is the effect of that virus so the
doctor analyzes where is the wire sitting in the body and then he gives
the medicine it goes to that place and kills the virus so we have to understand
where is this less sitting in my body so Lord Krishna tell senses mind and
intelligence are the sitting places of this last so Lord Krishna mentions
that's my thumb in the yard now though neom you've heard there's a bar pop
manam pledge he ain't on a big yana national therefore Oh Arjun best of the
in the very beginning curb this great symbol of sin lust by regulating the
senses and slay this destroyer of knowledge and self-realization Gyan and
the Gyan and national we are thinking we are advancing in the Gyan science Gyan
knowledge Krishna is telling not possible sir if you are having lust in
your body your Gyan and the Gyan are destroyed you are so much mad after
water that you have designed a wonderful machine to take that water out
but in your madness you did not realize it was not water it was mirage so all
your technology goes into dump it goes into waste similarly if we don't realize
that there is no happiness in this world because I am NOT the body matter cannot
satisfy me and I am engaged in technology better technology to have
better devices and more enjoyment so it is waste there is no water so in Hindi
they say that part of a mock or some sort of a sock Hota nae hae cable
dicta hae darbhan meh mukh means your face in mirror it is not there but you
only see that my face is there in the mirror just like the child is bewildered
so actually the moon has come in the bowl filled with water the moon is not
there in the bowl of water but it is appearing there similarly sansaar meh
sookh happiness in this world it is not there Krishna has defined the column but
dicta hae asa lakta hai there is happiness so as long as the living entity is lusty
Gyan and Gyan national these things will not make sense to him it destroys the
knowledge of living entity so that is why it is being told now very important
word is used in the very beginning the smart one in the Riani Ado Chanakya
Pandit says the senses fire disease should be controlled in the beginning
itself Chanakya Pandit was a very learned man so he tells just like fire
when it is spark you can control it if there is no spark there is no fire but
spark can immediately build into great fire and blast similarly disease in the
initial stages if it can be controlled easily cancer reaches fourth stage you
cannot control it initially some digestion disorder something you're
having can be controlled so senses disease and fire should be controlled in
the beginning in the beginning with that is why Brahmachari first training is
given 25 years control your senses very very nicely in the beginning if you do
not control you are indulge in the sense object the force would be so great would
be very very difficult so once a person has this force in the body very difficult
to turn back again so that is why in the beginning it has to be controlled how to
control it yes understood this thing is easy to understand how to control we are
not able to control so lot Krishna is telling the solution
affirmations will work no I'm I am happy I am very happy by simply by
thinking this you will be out of dissatisfaction this lusty disturbance in
life simply by some contemplation no no I should remain satisfied there is no
enjoyment simply by this contemplation you will be able to come out of it
simply by thinking I am not the body matter does not satisfy me will it help
us or following some psychological techniques I am happy I am very happy
these things are very much in vogue in society will it help you God is telling
no it will fail I have not designed the world like that it will not succeed how
you will succeed Krishna tells in the army but on yahood in the abhya for a
manah manasastu para buddhir yo buddhae for a test to sahay evam buddhae param
buddhva sans tabhya atmanam atmana jai shatram mahabhaho kamarupam durasadam
so Krishna tells in Duryani paranya ahur working senses are superior to dull
matter mind is higher than the senses intelligence is still higher than the
mind and the soul is even higher than intelligence so Krishna is telling
explaining the system of this mind body spirit complex so this complex which we
see it is combination of this gross body subtle body mind intelligence and soul
within just like a mine it is combination of mud stores and that
wonderful element gold or calcium or whatever we wanted iron from there you
have to remove the what mud and take that gold out in a similar fashion mud is
there and the soul is there within this body this is nothing but combination of
mud fire and water this body so entire Vedic civilization means take this
spirit soul out of this entanglement so these various energies in the body which
Krishna is explaining there are various levels of existence currently all of the
civilization almost all it is absorbed in in Duryani sensual level we want to
satisfy the senses somehow that is my objective of life in Durya but higher
than that is in Duryani paranya how in the Duryabhya paramanaha mind mental
level so we may be fond of eating eating is a very great pleasure we have
various restaurants and all these apps are making billions simply because of
satisfying the gross eating tendency satisfying the tongue however when you
play computer game you forget eating also sleeping is very great pleasures we
want to sleep 10 hours 12 hours 18 hours but when you play game you don't feel
sleepy also even if you are feeling sleepy you don't want to you forget it
you are practically unaffected so thus we understand when a person is absorbed
on mental level he forgets the influence of gross demands so some people get
scared oh if I follow this Krishna consciousness then my lust would be
finished and how will I enjoy things in life it is like telling patient is
thinking oh if I take this medicine my eczema would be cured then where is the
enjoyment of scratching it so it is foolishness we'll be getting much
higher pleasure will be relieved of this just like a person who is playing he is
enjoying much higher level of happiness so he's not at all bothered with the
happiness he does not think what should I cook what he forgets eating one day
two days people keep on playing sometimes because mental level he is
absorbed similarly the philosophers they are on mental level they may also
have not so-called very gross enjoyment they are philosophizing what is life
what is this what is that Kavi may have very simple life and then there is
Bodhi level of knowledge Sankhya yogis the Gyanis then they follow they are on
this intellectual level they are by always remaining on this intellectual
platform discussing Vedanta Veda just like the knowledge that we discussed
they always keep on contemplating upon this knowledge this is the purpose of
Sanyasi Gyaniyogi Sankhya yogi always Sankhya means atheistic usually Sankhya
otherwise it is Bhakti yoga so these people who follow Gyanis
impersonalists always they are thinking reading Vedanta and always absorbed this
is illusion illusion I am the body I am NOT the body and spirit soul different
from this body this life is temporary after this life I will enter into another
temporary dream like situation I'll pick up another body I am different from this
body bodily demands are not my demands in this way they try to remain on this
level and if they are lucky they can come to spiritual level yo buddhi parattas tu
sahaa there's another level mental level when a person starts enjoying on he
forgets the physical level when you love you fall in love you may forget other
comforts and people leave their rich families also just to have a life of
enjoyment with their beloved person why because mental level your pleasure you
are getting you don't care about other comforts similarly intellectual
pleasure observed by the Gyanis and higher than that is spiritual platform
when I am sleeping I am there on mental platform so I am NOT at all worried my
arm is twisted morning I'll pain my neck was sprained I would not realize the
pain when I am sleeping because I am absorbed on mental I am completely
different from away from this body and when a person is absorbed on
intellectual and what to speak of spiritual level so when a person is
absorbed in spiritual level whatever is happening in his body he will not be
disturbed by it so Krishna is telling here thus knowing oneself to be
transcendental to material senses even buddhi parambuddha mind and intelligence
buddha you are even higher than your intelligence also by understanding the
science very carefully this knowledge you should be able to realize your
position and one should control the lower self by higher self and thus by
spiritual strength conquer this insatiable enemy known as lust so although
intelligence is higher than mind mind is higher than senses and soul is higher
highest of all still the soul gets dragged by intelligence intelligence
gets dragged by mind mind gets dragged by senses when they are weak a tiger can
kill hundred dogs hundred dogs cannot kill a tiger but tiger's cub can be
killed in a similar fashion the spirit soul is very powerful it is supposed to
control intelligence mind and senses but when the soul becomes weak mind is weak
there is no strength senses pull them away so we have to gain spiritual
strength we have to make the spirit soul strong how does spirit soul become
strong by constant association with supreme spirit Krishna so this is the
only solution Krishna mentions by spiritual strength conquer this
insatiable and insatiable enemy known as lust so when we develop spiritual
strength by constant association with Krishna so just like the enemy could be
sitting in many places so the enemy may come to the mountain range easy to fend
off you can push the enemy away push it out enemy can capture some district
difficult little difficult and if enemy comes and captures the capital then the
country is lost then enemy will spread its influence in the entire country
very soon similarly the capital the lust is sitting in the intelligence so if
we can remove the lust from there all the activities of the senses they are
centered around mind which is controlled by intelligence so if the intelligence
is purified and in the mind Krishna is always sitting then we can very easily
established control over the senses drive the enemy out but if the lust is
sitting in the heart in the intelligence then it is very very difficult so what
we have to do is the lust is nothing but darkness ignorance when the Sun rises
darkness automatically goes away so simply place Krishna in your senses in
your intelligence so when there is Sun automatically darkness goes away in a
similar fashion automatically lust will be driven out when God is placed
Krishna is placed in our intelligence in our mind and in the senses how to place
Krishna it is very simple so Krishna consciousness is very easy process now
you cannot tell simply do not indulge in sense enjoyment but there is a very nice
process you want to eat offer very nice food stuffs make a nice samosa fry it in
ghee and then offer to Krishna and then you take it so your tongue is controlled
you want to eat various sweet dishes please offer it to Krishna and then you
take it in this way your tongue is controlled so this is not lust because
Krishna is satisfied when you take prasadam of Krishna lust means now lust
does not mean the way you are discussing eating we are discussing about lust no
lust does not mean simply sexual urge that is the grossest manifestation lust
is defined in the Vedas any kind of tendency for self-satisfaction without
satisfying Krishna Atmendriya Preeti Vansha so the same thing which impels a
person for sexual activities it impels a person to eat watch and hear the same
thing same energy it is called lust and why this lust is there in the body it is
transformation of love when you love your child then only you become angry
that love transforms into anger you don't get angry with any person who is
doing some naughtiness but when the child you think a child may harm himself you
become angry the love gets transformed into anger in a similar fashion we have
this energy we have love of God all the souls because we are part of God but
when we do not love God then the same energy transforms into lust now my heart
is completely empty because there is no love in life now when a person does not
have love then he may engage in various pleasures but when he gets his beloved
person he may leave all the opulences and comforts of rich father or parents
also in a similar very simple example we have all realized isn't it so when you
have the object of love in front of you you are willing to give up everything
thus people give their life also when there is no love in life that is not
love that is also lust in this material world but people don't want to live also
just see so much disturbed living entities Prabhupada gives very striking
example in concentration camp sometimes nothing was given to them to eat so the
people the prisoners were eating their stool and there was earthquake and the
brothers were found buried for many many days and people were surprised how you
could survive for these many days without food and water so they told we
were drinking each other's urine in this way we are able to sustain so living
entity has to eat something so if there is no higher pleasure then something
nasty stuff also they will eat and drink so when there is no higher pleasure in
life love of God present in our life then a person falls down to these lusty
affairs and a person is never satisfied so the solution is engaging in the
service of Krishna and the service of Krishna begins with tongue so always we
have to chant and hear the names of Krishna with great love and attention
understanding that this name of Krishna is not different from Krishna and your
intelligence should be used how to Krishna mentions when a person reads
Bhagavad-gita he is worshipping me by his intelligence when you do aarti of
Lord you are worshipping him by your hands and when you are reading Bhagavad-gita
you are worshipping Krishna by your intelligence so in this way intelligence
is engaged in service of Krishna by understanding the Vedas Krishna's
instructions intelligence is also free of lust so that is why Prabhupada tells not
just reading you have to contemplate upon it the entire day so rather than
reading entire chapter and forgetting it read one shloka but remember it for
the rest of the day intelligence has to be engaged otherwise intelligence lust
will capture it and when we are chanting and hearing very very nicely our mind
becomes absorbed in the holy name of Krishna so by practice you will realize
when you are chanting and hearing attentively mind becomes locked and then
when you advance further form of Krishna is also awakened in the heart and you
are always thinking of Krishna within your heart so when Krishna is in this
way firmly seated in the heart in the mind where is the question of senses
engaging in lusty affairs because mind controls the senses so in this way we
have to engage but nevertheless senses also have to be purified some people
have very lusty eyes cannot control the eyes some people are very lusty ears
want to hear always addicted to hearing some people are have lusty tongue not
very much indulging in eyes and ears but cannot control tongue so all these
senses also have to be purified that is why we have deity worship see the form
of Krishna in the temple eyes become purified and when you hear the keertas
you hear japa the auditory sense becomes satisfied becomes clear of lust the ear
will not demand of hearing any other thing mundane thing similarly when your
tongue is always taking prasadam it will become control it will not demand
anything else so this is the process God is telling you will be satisfied your
spirit soul when you engage in my service supreme spirit so in this way I
request all of you please understand all this technology civilization it is
simply making instruments just to rub that eczema sore in the body scratch it
it will not work the solution is finish this eczema finish this unnecessary
strong push which is never satisfied and that can be done by engaging in
service of Krishna so we have to practice always we are in touch with
Krishna always we keep on chanting it is very simple tongue is there with us when
we are not eating not engage elsewhere keep on chanting always at least 16
rounds try to do attentively and there's one more very very powerful thing which
makes everything very easy as some people were asking what is the best way
to become dear to Krishna Krishna is seated in the heart when he sees that
the living entity is struggling very very nicely he is engaging in my service
when Krishna becomes pleased he can tell material energy stop do not disturb this
person so how Krishna can be pleased you all can read chapter 18 verse 68 69
Krishna tells many people are dear to me but the dearest is yeah imam paramam
who spreads this knowledge to others because all living entities are part and
parcel sons of Krishna is very much concerned why they are suffering
satisfying this last this knowledge should be given to them so anybody who
spreads this knowledge acts on behalf of Krishna he becomes topmost devotee of
Krishna and he becomes very way and Krishna tells in future also I will not
tell a person who is doing this seva is more dear like that never in future
Namib who yeah in future also nobody shall be more dearer to me than the
person who preaches so Prabhupada was preaching some of his disciples so
control your senses very nicely follow the rules and regulations and still the
senses will bite test will come so how to come out of it when the senses are
biting so Prabhupada mentioned you preach and pray to Krishna and Krishna
will help so prayers will be easily answered when the person is pleased so I
request all of you to realize this knowledge and engage yourself in
preaching spreading this knowledge directly preaching and convincing
others may take a lot of advancement in ability so we can connect them you can
bring them to session you can bring them to Prabhupada by distributing the books
of Prabhupada lectures of Prabhupada in this way you can connect with Prabhupada
connect with the devotees who can preach in this way everybody can preach and by
preaching preaching is very easy way and Prabhupada tells if you want to have in
Kali Yuga we cannot attract Krishna's attention by any other means so this by
this preaching when we spread this knowledge to others very quickly we
attract the attention of Krishna so please chant the names of Krishna and
try to spread this knowledge to others by this do not worry evidence is there
in the history Jagai Madhai the great drunkards and Haridas Thakur converted
a prostitute overnight without any preaching simply by chanting he
converted and all the Westerners who were indulged in all the activities and all of
us in this culture everyone is born in lust and we are trained how to increase
our lust but the example is there how so many devotees are able to have such a
pure life so you need not have any doubt from the ancient history people have
been falling and they've got tremendous success by following this process so
there is sure short assurance and all of you are also evidence of this you
yourself have realized those who are practicing for some time following rules
and regulations very nicely how you have been able to conquer all this lust to a
great extent whatever little disturbance may be there here and there it will also
go away slowly if you can simply simply stick to the process nicely so today
also the time is up and we could not chant one round of Hare Krishna maha
mantra which is very very important so nevertheless it is my duty to tell so
we'll be taking up questions but many people are new so please understand this
process by which you will be able to completely defeat this enemy for sure
and this begins with mantra meditation Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna
Krishna Hare Hare Hare Ram Hare Ram Ram Ram
