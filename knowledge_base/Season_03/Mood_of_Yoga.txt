teachers have held a great importance especially in India the position of
teacher is very very exalted of course now it is diminishing it has diminished
to a great extent like one of our devotees who is a professor in one of the
management colleges of the country so he's telling so these day students say
hi hi sir not even sir they may call the name also this is the culture but on
the other hand what we have seen what we have read in our school is the
Sanskrit shlokas they glorify the position of teacher like anything
guru Brahma guru Devo guru Vishnu guru Devo Maheshwara guru Sakshat para
so guru is compared to Brahma Vishnu Mahesh so why such exalted position is
given to guru what is guru teaching me some subject accounts maths physics
chemistry history sociology so why for such subjects such an exalted position
is given to spiritual master
so guru means one who brings from darkness of ignorance to light of
knowledge
but what kind of knowledge so every living entity is having some intelligence
and is having some knowledge also but human beings are especially very very
intelligent compared to other species of life so we have seen many many years
have passed centuries have passed but other species they continue to live the
way they have been living for many many hundreds of years dog was on the street
dog remains on the street dog was not able to make a house for itself it still
does not have the capacity to make a house for itself the bird was living in
a nest the bird is still living in a nest and in the very same nest monkeys
were on tree monkeys are still on the trees so all the other species if you
observe they do have knowledge they do have intelligence but the knowledge they
the intelligence is very very low they can just satisfy their gross bodily
needs by that knowledge they cannot improve their standard of living they
cannot counteract they cannot come out of the miseries which they have been
facing they have to tolerate and human being on the other hand if we see human
being has improved his standard of living as the people perceive it they
have improved the standard of living like anything from the mud houses in the
village now we can see how it is so amazing we have such big buildings huge
skyscrapers from bullock cart we have jets now jumbo jets and so much
advancement we have made we have these wonderful communication technologies
animals communicate in the same way so humans have extraordinarily high
intelligence as compared to animals but unfortunately due to the absence of
right teacher who is called guru who is so much glorified in the Vedas we also
end up doing the same thing using all this advanced sciences and technology
and knowledge what the animals are doing that is eating mating sleeping and
defending so ultimately all this science everything is for what for eating I
want to eat nice things advanced things imported things eating mating sleeping
have nice house big house for what for sleeping and defending defense
mechanisms they may defend themselves from their claws we may have some
advanced jets and missiles but the purpose is same for these four
activities and how much ever advanced you may become to enjoy these
animalistic propensities the purpose of knowledge is not served the purpose of
knowledge is to solve all the miseries of one's existence that is why a right
guru is required so many gurus are engaged especially India is a factory of
producing gurus many many research scholars Indian colleges they churn out
every year every year or twice in a year but despite all these ever increasing
gurus and modern gurukuls people are becoming more and more dissatisfied and
actually if we see the best in the best so-called gurukul or university what we
may call it it has the highest number of suicide rates and highest number of
depressed cases almost half of the people are depressed in the best
education imparting Institute of the world so actually if we want to give
some other name for this occasion that the world is celebrating today teachers
day it would be better if we call it the cheaters day oh cheaters no no it is
teachers no it is if anybody has knowledge of Vedas Bhagavatam so he can
very clearly perceive how it is not the teachers day but the cheaters day
without any offenses to anybody who is teaching hate the sin not the sinner so
we see everyone as part and parcel of Krishna animals also what to speak of
human beings even trees and all the living entities but the activity is not
good so the scriptures are telling Mata Nasa Syad Pita Nasa Syad Guru Nasa Syad
Bandhu Nasa Syad Naya Dmoch Yathe Samupetah Mrityam a person does not
have right to become father mother or guru teacher or relative if he cannot
give relief to his student or dependent Samupetah Mrityam from the clutches of
death so actually spiritual master is meant in human form of life we have such
a wonderful intelligence that we can learn the science and technology of
stopping this death altogether so this science is very very rare and such a
teacher is also very very rare who can stop somebody's death and unless
somebody is capable of doing that he should not become teacher then he's
cheater he's simply cheating living entity if you go to a college and
college teaches you everything all the subjects very very nicely but then the
degree they do not give you cannot find a job after studying in that college
then what is the use of that college that is cheating even though you have
taught me everything but the purpose of knowledge is not met so what is the
purpose of all knowledge that we have what is the purpose of spiritual master
guru that is Samupetah Mrityam that is to stop death stop old age stop disease
these are the real problems of life unfortunately we have become very used
to seeing all these problems so there is a very great historical incident about
this realization in our country so we have the great example of Gautam Buddha
so he was born as a prince so he's one of the greatest teachers that the world
has seen so Gautam Buddha was born as a prince and then because people were
knowing the science of astrology at that time they told this person either he
would be a great king or he would become a renunciant so then the king got
scared oh my son there is there are chances of him renouncing the entire
kingdom so why a person renounces when he sees there is no pleasure no
enjoyment in this world so that is why he leaves in search of happiness higher
happiness or truth so then they devised that let us bring him up in such an
environment that he does not see any misery around him and what are the
miseries of life many small miseries and big miseries we are creating now but
how much ever we create or we do not create the fundamental and the most
serious miseries always exist and which are those miseries birth death old age
and disease our questions can be posted after the session is over I will be able
to answer only the questions which are posted after chanting so please park
your questions for a while then we'll have enough time to discuss so Gautam
Buddha he was given such an environment where he did not see anybody suffering
from the biggest miseries and that is he never saw any old man around him he was
not allowed to have association with any person who is diseased he was not allowed
to witness a death so there is no misery you are seeing all the people young all
the people smiling happy no miserable person was allowed to go to him but then
he grew up and ultimately how long you can keep him inside he wants to see the
world and then he went out and then he saw a leper or some diseased person and
then he asked his associate what is this what is this situation I've never seen
him what has happened to him you know this called disease disease what is this
how does it happen can it happen to me also yes sir it happens to everyone it
will happen everyone suffers from diseases here and he was shocked my god
we can have leprosy our fingers will come out of our body my god it's so
horrible and then he moved further and then he saw another person he was a
hunchback and then so what is this person we seem very weird and very
skinny don't know this is natural in old age what is old age that's our old age
everyone suffers from old age this is what we are going to become in future we
are all going to grow old my god we are all going to become like this it is very
horrible and then he saw some people were carrying a dead body and then he
asked what is this happening and then he told this person is dead like dead what
is dead what a dead means you no longer are conscious and you don't exist in
this world not dead this will happen to us yes definitely it will happen to
everyone and this was enough for him he told why are we wasting our time here we
are going to die we are temporary we are going to grow old we are going to get
and what is the solution of these problems so this world is having such
great miseries and nobody is wondering about it and then immediately developed
such a strong renunciation he left the house left his palace and he worked how
to solve these problems of life so this is called knowledge but however we have
so much used to it that it is normal we are seeing everyone is having specs so
wearing spectacles is a norm now which was very very rare before wearing mask
could be a norm in some places having filtered water is a norm we have
polluted so much water similarly air purifiers will become the new norm so
these things have become normal for us however it is not normal so any sane
human being using his very advanced intelligence should try to find out the
solution of these problems so this is called real knowledge and a person who
gives such a knowledge he is considered the most benevolent personality of this
world and such a personality is very very rare that is why the scripture still
Akshano phalam tvadrish darshanam he the perfection of I every machine
instrument has got perfect use or optimal usage the mobile phone today
smart devices can also be used as torch can also be used as paperweight however
that is not the optimal use of the device optimal use of smartphone is it
can be used as a computer also it is mini computer and if a person simply
uses that device as a as a torch or as paperweight then you need not spend so
much money for that paperweight is very cheap in a similar fashion this human
form of life is meant to attain an extraordinary kind of happiness and
solve all these problems we need not supposed to get old we need not supposed
to get disease we can stop our death and human life is meant to understand that
science that technology by which we can stop these miseries and a person who
knows the science he is called guru so perfection of this human body it is
told Akshano phalam we have eyes in this body wonderful cameras so we use the eyes
for seeing many things we use it for watching movies we use it for watching
our beloved relatives around us we use it for so many things but the best use by
which your eyes can derive maximum happiness that is seeing the form of a
pure devotee action of a lumped water is Darshan him he donno phalam thwadrish
got to Sangha perfection of touch we use sense of touch for various kinds of
pleasures but what is the maximum pleasure that the sensual touch this
touch perception can give us that is touching your lotus feet touching the
lotus feet of a pure devotee of Guru jiva phalam thwadrish kirtanam he jiva
the tongue is used for producing various sounds so what is the perfection of
tongue thwadrish kirtanam he chanting the names of guru so Durlabha
and such a bhagavata so guru spiritual master is called bhagavata an actual
guru bhagavata means anything which is connected to God God is called Bhagawan
and anything which is in connection with God that is called bhagavata so we have
got a book which is called bhagavatam it is called bhagavatam because it
contains subject matters only directly related to God similarly there are some
people who are always in connection with God constant connection and those
people who never forget God for a single moment every moment of the entire day
24 hours whatever activities they do the activities are in connection and in the
service of God they are called bhagavat and such a person can give actual
knowledge because he is in direct contact with God God is the creator
because of his being in direct contact with God he can give us the perfect
knowledge of God so thus a guru is called bhagavat and so Durlabha bhagavata
he loke in this universe such a guru is very very rare such a personality so
that is why a guru Brahma guru Vishnu guru Devo Maheshwara he's compared to
Brahma Vishnu and Maheshwara he is representative of supreme God
directly and there is another very nice name used for such an enlightened
spiritual master and that is called tatva vid. Tatva means truth absolute truth
human life is only meant for knowing truth because if you follow truth you
become happy and vid means to know any person who knows truth he is called
so another terminology used for such a bona fide spiritual master guru is tatva vid
so Arjuna is bewildered about his duties because let us come back to our
karma yoga topic karma yoga means actions Arjuna doesn't want to do
action the duty of fighting and Krishna is telling you fight so Arjuna is
telling what is the difference then an ordinary person is also fighting I want
to become spiritualist I want to leave all these things and you are telling me
also to fight and you are telling this is spiritual paths how come fighting is
spiritual path so Krishna quotes a very nice verse here and that is the
instruction of tatva vid if you do your actions under the guidance of tatva vid
such a guru a person who knows tatva who knows truth then your actions become
yoga your actions become completely spiritual fighting will become spiritual
sleeping will become spiritual walking and talking will become spiritual making
a phone call will become spiritual if that activity is done as per the
direction of tatva vid oh really so let me have that direction and whatever
activity I am doing that becomes a spiritual activity so what is this
instruction my voice is cracking can others please type it if it is actually
cracking so I've got some comment in the chat box or is it clear it's clear so
many others have told it is clear so maybe it is internet issue at your side
thank you thank you so much done 20 30 comments so let us now continue with the
Bhagavad-gita and try to understand what is instruction of that that way
text number 28 chapter 3 tattva vittu mahabhah guna karma vibhagayoh guna guneshu vartanta iti matvana sajjate
Lord Krishna is telling to Arjuna one who is a knowledge of the absolute truth
almighty armed does not engage himself in the senses and sense gratification knowing
well the differences between work and devotion and work for fruitive results
another word used for guru or the knowledge of truth is kritsna vid tattva vid and kritsna vid krits means complete if you are accepting a guru to solve the
problems of life you should make sure he has knowledge about entire existence
kritsam vid because if he does not have knowledge about one thing then you would
suffer so kritsam vid means a person who has complete knowledge factual
knowledge so Lord Krishna is telling here bewildered by modes of material
nature the ignorant fully engage themselves in material activities and
become attached so what are the actions of those who do not have knowledge here
it is mentioned ignorant fully engage themselves in material activities and
become attached so we have got so much knowledge so now we can measure are we
actually knowledgeable in terms of that with in terms of Krishna or not so we
can see how much attached we are in our activities so if I am very much attached
to my activity to the result of my activity I am very much attached to this
money which I am getting off my job I am very much attached to the result which
I am getting from my studies I am very much attached to the people I am living
amongst whom I am very much attached to the house where I am living in so in the
ignorant people they engage themselves in material activities and become
attached so if you are very much attached to the people place surroundings
or resources it means we have not cultivated knowledge but ignorance in
our life so what the why should do those were noise not wise they are
attached in doing the activities so wise should not unsettle them although
these duties are inferior due to performers lack of knowledge so the way
does mention to process naturally people are very much attached because they are
ignorant they are attached to the dresses which the person is wearing never
knowing who is the person wearing the dress these bodies however there are
some duties even though you are attached you want to enjoy the happiness here in
this world which anyway will not satisfy you but if you want to fulfill you want
to try the way does mention some duties so gradually for person dutifully tries
to enjoy this world he will come to the platform of knowledge one day so it is
not possible directly to develop inquisitiveness and to develop the
capacity to understand absolute truth so that is why Krishna is telling Arjuna so
ignorant people should not be disturbed let them remain attached but do all the
activities as per the instructions of the Vedas do not unsettle them you
please follow you have understood you follow you do not unsettle them and how
you should follow does not engage himself in the senses and sense
gratification knowing well the differences between work and devotion and
work for fruitive results so both the people that were with a person who knows
truth and a person who is ignorant who is materially very much attached both
will work but one person who is ignorant he works for fruitive results as is just
mentioned in the last line of the translation if you are working because
you want to enjoy the results of your work then we are ignorant and we will
continue to suffer however a spiritualist a perfect knower of truth may
also work in the very same fashion but his work is work in devotion and it does
not engage in the activities of senses and sense gratification why a person
wants to result a materialist because he wants to enjoy his senses he wants to
do sense gratification sense enjoyment so person who knows absolute truth a
person who knows relative truth what is relative truth which is not always true
what is your name if somebody asks us we can tell something this is my name that
is called relative truth my name may change if I go to some other country I
may be given a different name and when I was small people would call me by
different name in house I may have a different name outside I may have a
different name in their reference somebody's reference I have got this
name but that is not absolute truth so those people who are having knowledge of
relative truth for them sense enjoyment is everything in life because it is true
as soon as you put a very nice sweet on the tongue you get happiness so very
nice so this is truth you are perceiving putting sweet on the tongue means
happiness this is true you have actually perceived it but if you know
further that no no no I am having diabetes although when I put sweet on
the tongue it gives me pleasure but because I am knowing this sweet when it
enters my body it will give me tremendous misery so I should not engage
in this sense enjoyment so in this way a person who has knowledge of relative
truth he thinks oh enjoying the senses is so nice that is the aim of life let
me satisfy the eyes by whatever they want satisfy the tongue by water tongue
whatever whatever it wants skin whatever it wants because I become immediately
happy by that but a person with knowledge of absolute truth who has
wholesome knowledge he understands this very happiness is a cause of all
miseries for the living entity so the relative truth knowers they should not
be called teachers but cheaters so what cheater will tell us you study very
nicely son or daughter you get a good job do good business have a startup have
lot of money and then have a nice life partner and then I have nice kids let
them also go to the same cycle and this is the perfection of life sense
enjoyment is a perfection of life so any person any teacher who is giving such
knowledge he is cheater teacher will give this knowledge that with what
knowledge do not engage so Krishna is also quoting that that with norse of
truth nor of truth does not engage himself in senses and sense gratification
because he knows this very sense enjoyment it causes all the miseries in
our life it awards me more and more bodies material bodies which are the
sources of miseries of death disease old age and birth so that's we can see
the stark difference between a cheater and a teacher they give totally opposite
instructions so Arjun is supposed to engage in work but he has to engage in
work in a different consciousness so that is why Sheila Prabhupada tells it is
not that everyone will get purified by taking dip in the Ganges it is not that
everyone will find satisfaction when he goes to Vrindavan whether a person will
get purified spiritually advanced or not it depends upon his consciousness so
spiritual activity means involvement of spirit is required as what is spirit
means consciousness how do we understand this where the spirit is lying by
consciousness there is spirit in this body so this body's consciousness this
table does not have spirit so table is not having consciousness so if you want
to do spiritual activity so the trick lies in the consciousness or the mood
as is the topic for today so many many people will follow the same sadhana same
spiritual practice same chanting they would do same reading they would do
same seva they would do but advancement would be different everyone is chanting
lakhs of people in the world they chant 16 rounds lakhs of people not lakhs
number is little less thousands would be doing mangala in their house and they
would be reading the books but where is the difference the difference lies in
consciousness so that is why when Sheila Prabhupada was asked by reporter so if a
devotee he sees somebody has met with an accident you are telling that we should
work for the spiritual cause not worry much about body so will he save that
person or not so Prabhupada told everything depends upon consciousness
external activities are not the criteria for judging the spiritual result of that
activity so that is why so many fighters are fighting on the battlefield
of Kurukshetra for some fighting was a spiritual affair and for others fighting
was a completely material affair so what is that consciousness which a yogi is
supposed to adopt so that his activities can be works of devotion that Krishna
further mentions to Arjuna but this is the foundation the foundation is
activity should not be for sense gratification and sense enjoyment anybody
who knows the absolute truth will not work to this end so Krishna mentions so
very important shloka Prabhupada tells this shloka indicates the purpose of
Bhagavad Gita and the shloka is my sarvani karmaani sannyasya adhyatma
so very important words are mentioned here so Krishna is telling now somebody
may ask I should not work for the fruits of the activity then why should I work
at all so many works I can do why should I engage in that activity so Krishna is
telling no that particular fruit that work you please surrender unto me you do
that work only for me because I am telling you to do that work therefore
Arjuna surrendering all your works unto me with mind intent on me and
without desire for gain and free from egoism and lethargy fight so
Shloka Prabhupada mentions this words clearly indicates the purpose of
Bhagavad Gita so we are all trying to understand read Bhagavad Gita so we
should know what is the purpose of Bhagavad Gita what is that I am supposed
to attain after finishing this Bhagavad Gita so Prabhupada tells this verse clearly
indicates the purpose of Bhagavad Gita and what is the purpose of Bhagavad Gita
any activity that we are doing it should be surrendered to Krishna what does it
mean surrendered to Krishna it should be done strictly under the guidance of
Krishna so if you can take guidance directly from Krishna as Arjuna was
taking here Krishna was his charioteer or Lord Brahma he was able to take
guidance directly from Krishna or Sanat Kumara they were able to take the
direction directly from Krishna if you are so fortunate we can do that if you
are not so fortunate still we can become equally fortunate by surrendering our
activities to the representative of Krishna it is same thing you put the
letter in the post office or you put in the letter box the result is the same
all the letter box may appear small or post office so many people are sitting I
have given it may reach no don't do all this calculation a letter box is
completely authorized by the post office if you put letter in that that small
letter box works exactly like a post office same thing will happen to the
letter which is put into the letter box so that is why Krishna tells just like a
letter box should be taken as non-different from post office whether
you put in post office or in the letter box it is the same thing no difference
oh if I put in the post post office letter will reach faster it would be
more safe no same no difference in a similar fashion Krishna tells Acharya
the Acharya actual guru should be taken as non-different from me never disobey
the spiritual master he should be taken as non-different from myself
Krishna is telling so if we cannot surrender our activities directly to
Krishna like Arjuna was doing we can do it for spiritual master and there is no
difference at all that Krishna will explain in the next chapter so all the
activity should strictly be done not calculating what will benefit me as
Krishna mentions here without desire for gain so sometimes when we engage in the
activities in Krishna consciousness also we think what is my gain what is the
gain what will I get some and sometimes some people think Oh Prabhu I have I'm
not getting so much pleasure in chanting these days and if I feel I chant
peacefully one round of Hare Krishna Mahamantra it is better than finishing
16 rounds in haste or like that so we are calculating always my gain my gain
what will I get here so if we are engaging in spiritual activities we
should give up this business of always calculating my personal gain as we
discuss in the last class also a small child he's completely dependent upon
the parents in a similar fashion a spiritualist is completely dependent
upon Krishna not just for spiritual pleasure material pleasure but even
spiritual pleasure also a neophyte spiritualist he does not worry about
spiritual gains because material gains because he knows material gains may
bring will bring only misery so let me work for spiritual gains but Lord
Krishna himself has given an extraordinary philosophy and the
highest philosophy of spiritual life in which a person sacrifices a spiritual
pleasure also. Srila Prabhupada was very very comfortably living in Vrindavan
I had no difficulty over there and when Srila Prabhupada he started his
journey on Jalduta so during this time we are reading Prabhupada's diary in all our
temples every morning it is a part of morning program we call it Jalduta
diary so every day Prabhupada was taking down some notes in his diary so we read
that every day so in that way we are able to relate with Prabhupada which
mood Prabhupada was facing 50 years ago when he was traveling on this day so
around last week or before that Prabhupada suffered from two heart attacks during
this time and then when he went he had so much misery I'm spiritual master is
never having any misery because spiritually he's always enlightened in
touch with Krishna but on material level so many hardships and spiritual
pleasure also was so much in Vrindavan but Srila Prabhupada left that spiritual
pleasure also so-called very comfortable and congenial environment of Vrindavan
also and it took all these troubles Prabhupada told even though when I'm
sitting in New York I'm not in New York I'm always in Vrindavan I'm always
thinking of Vrindavan and I was very very comfortable here but suffering from
heart attacks and in old age coming in such a cold and frozen country why I
have come here it is for the pleasure of Krishna similarly the nectar of devotion
gives a description the charioteer of Krishna when he sees Krishna he comes in
ecstasy so now we are so much in ignorance we think we are these bodies
just like in sickness we are not able to get the taste of very tasty food stuffs
also in a similar fashion as long as we think I am this body we will not be able
to relish spiritual pleasure but the liberated souls like Krishna's charioteer
as soon as they see Krishna they come in ecstasy and it is very difficult to
concentrate on the works so because he is Krishna's charioteer he gives up
looking towards Krishna and he gives up the spiritual pleasure which he gets by
seeing Krishna and he focuses on his duties similarly one person he was doing
fan and he was about to faint seeing the Lord but then he focused on his duties
and he gave up his spiritual pleasure because in spiritual pleasure also a
person becomes mad in ecstasy and he may faint also but in the service of
Krishna a pure devotee he gives up spiritual pleasure also his desire is
only to engage in the service of Krishna or spiritual master this is real
education system Brahmachari Guru Kule Vasanthanto Guru Hitham so a person is
taught don't do sense enjoyment sense gratification try to act on a spiritual
level Brahmachari Brahmachari on Brahma level Vasanthanto he lives in the Guru
Kule for Dante controlling the senses and he works for not his own gain we
take this modern education for my gain but in Guru Kule every disciple is taught
to work for Guru Hitham to work for the gain for the pleasure comfort of
spiritual master so this training is required in life not desire no desire
for personal gain but the gain of Krishna or gain of spiritual master so
when we are following spiritual life this thing we should give up this is the
mood in spiritual life also if you are calculating oh when will I get this when
will I get that oh I am doing so much puja and I am getting disease I am
having sickness and I am having proper never calculated like that I have
started in this old age to the West to preach Krishna consciousness and before
landing in US I have got heart attack that two attacks that to not one why
Krishna is not protecting me no yes Krishna definitely would have avoided
all these things but by these examples Krishna wants to show what is actual
spiritual life what should be the mood of a spiritualist even though there is
heart attack that heart attack should also be taken as great blessing of
Krishna so as we discussed we have to take this concept completely away from
our life that pleasure of body is my pleasure and discomfort to the body is
my discomfort no just like if somebody's clothes they are they have got fire the
clothes have to be removed immediately sometimes the brakes of the vehicle
have failed and he knows my vehicle is going to go down in the valley then the
person jumps out let the vehicle go he should not desire to protect the vehicle
but at the other time he should desire to protect the vehicle ordinarily if the
vehicle hits another vehicle he will also suffer so if that is the case you
should protect your vehicle in this circumstances you should leave the
vehicle let the vehicle go and get destroyed so whether I should protect
the vehicle or not depends whether the driver would be protected as a result of
that activity or not in a similar fashion sometimes miseries are very very
good for us physical miseries and mental miseries by this we realize Krishna
consciousness we realize the temporary nature of this material world our heart
becomes purified so that is why devotee has firm faith if I am following
Krishna sometimes Krishna may give discomfort to my mind and body sometimes
he may give pleasure to my mind and body but devotee completely remains
dependent and full of gratitude for Krishna's reciprocation even though that
reciprocation could be in form of hardship or anything and when he is
having such a mood then he advances very fast in spiritual life so first of all
all the works work everyone will do a spiritualist can write as good as a
computer program as a non-spiritualist materialist would do but he would do
that programming only if his guru tells him to do that all the work should be
surrendered to Krishna and without desire for personal gain and with mind
intent on me this is also very very important thing
means mind intent on Krishna what does it mean intent this word is very important
intent means attention full of eagerness just like we have example of cricket
match it is a last over and you need so many runs in so many balls and with
great intent people watch every ball every motion and how it is happening
eager attention so when we are engaged in any activity we are sweeping the
floor cleaning the floor doing any activity going to office doing business
if we have to qualify that action as yoga mine should be intent upon Krishna
so if you read the translation it the word by word meaning it tells something
Adhyatma Chetasa means with full knowledge of the self and Chetasa means
consciousness but what is this full knowledge that Krishna will explain
further in the 18th chapter and because Prabhupada knows entire Bhagavad Gita he
is giving us directly the actual meaning so full knowledge of the self means when
a person is having full knowledge of the self the self is part and parcel of
super self this called full knowledge and he develops immense attraction for
the super self and thus he is very intent upon seeing the super self Krishna within
his heart so that's my should be intent upon Krishna with great eagerness a
person should be seeing the lotus feet of Krishna within his heart so all the
work should be done as per Krishna's direction and the work should be for
Krishna's gain and mind also should be intent upon Krishna not that I'm
thinking of something else and I'm doing this thing so when we are chanting
Prabhupada's you are chanting Krishna's name but you are thinking of something
else that is an offense such a chanting may take a very very long time to bear
fruit and if you are not conscious to remove the offenses our spiritual life
may get choked by such chanting and free from egoism and lethargy now these
words are also very very important Nirmama is the word exactly used in the
shloka Nirmama Nirashi Nirmama Bhutva mama means something belongs to me
egoism I am this body so why we are so much concerned about so many people are
dying but if my something happens to my relatives father mother son daughter
oh I become so much anxious why I'm so much anxious it is because of this false
ego mama they belong to me I think these people they belong to me so something
happens to them I become very much disturbed
just like in Mahabharat Karna was told that these Pandavas are your brothers
little why you are telling me now that they are my brothers now immediately
mama has come oh they belong to me so why we get disturbed from somebody's
death when I think somebody belongs to me they are mine so we have to be free
from this concept none of the people belong to me we are living together like
travelers they all belong to Krishna we all belong to Krishna in that way we are
related to each other but not directly related to each other and in different
dresses we come together and then we move on and mama also means the property
so if some money is going on is going away some robbery has happened in the
neighbor's house I would not be disturbed but if robbery happens in my
house I would be very very disturbed why because I think it is my money which has
gone and a Brahmana is not at all disturbed Brahmana is supposed to
follow Satyam and Arjavam even if an enemy comes and asks where is your money
he will tell here is my money Brahmana is not supposed to tell lie he
understand entire money everything belongs to Krishna so if Krishna gives
it will be here I'll use for Krishna service something goes Krishna is
taking it away
so if I am sitting in front middle midst of some property the property also
belongs to Krishna so I should not think it belongs to me so when I am engaged in
Krishna service sometimes oh so much time I've engaged in Krishna service
entire time belongs to Krishna Krishna is creator of time for so much money I
viewed in Krishna service so I've used less actually I should just take for
maintenance of body and soul together although it is such consciousness is
difficult so householders are allowed to have to use up to 50% of their wealth
but those people who are strictly into spiritual life Brahmachari, Vanaprastha,
Sannyasi they are not supposed to possess anything more than maintenance
of the body so because nothing belongs to us so when I am engaged in service of
Krishna I should not think oh this much service I've rendered rather I should
think oh entire time entire money all the resources belong only to Krishna how
fallen I am that I am not able to engage everything in service of Krishna this is
called free from egoism nirmama nothing belongs to me and lethargy now if a
person thinks or nothing belongs to me everything is belongs to Krishna only I
am not going to gain anything by this work so then a person may become lazy in
Krishna consciousness no this also should not be done
Vigata Jwara, free from lethargy even though nothing belongs to me even though
I am not supposed to gain anything but then I'm not supposed to be lethargic
I am supposed to use all the enthusiasm that a materialist is using for making
money and name in this world so just like some devotees were telling who are
trying to preach and bring others into Krishna consciousness that trouble what
to do people are not coming so I told what have you done to bring the people
for just like we have the evening Bhagavad Gita discussions and we tell
them please engage more people into it so they are telling people people are
not coming so I asked what you have done for it so you are having your business
also how do you run your business if you have to sell your product to somebody
how would you do marketing oh yes Prabhu we use pyramid structure and so many
things we use we touch base with so many people and try to cultivate them and
somebody may take our product somebody may fund us so yes so the same strategy
is the same enthusiasm without any lethargy we have to use all those things
in Krishna consciousness same thing same computer a materialist with you
will use a spiritualist we are also using without any lethargy with same
expertise with same skills we have to use and then fight then do your duty so
this is the mood of a yogi surrendering all the works unto Krishna so when we
realize Bhagavad Gita we are supposed to be acting on this platform all the work
should be done strictly under the guidance of Krishna for Krishna gain is
not ours gain is of Krishna's and mine should be intent upon Krishna with
great eagerness we should attentively be seeing the form of Krishna within the
heart and we should be free from egoism that anything belongs to me everything
belongs to Krishna only Krishna is given to me so that I can offer it to Krishna
and increase my love for Krishna and without any lethargy using all the
skills energy I should engage in the service of Krishna in this way are all
works whatever we do it gets transformed into spiritual work and a person becomes
karma yogi otherwise he's a Karmic materialist so there's the difference
between a Karmic and a Karmic yogi so this mood is very important so as
Prabhupada told consciousness so please read the shloka carefully and whenever
you are engaging in service of Krishna try to see try to
