Today we are going to, we will try to wind up the 4th chapter Transcendental Knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita.
So in the previous session we covered a very important verse
without which it is not possible to begin one's spiritual life or realize the transcendental knowledge.
And that shloka was
So to summarize whatever we have read in the 4th chapter so far, Transcendental Knowledge
Lord Krishna explained to Arjuna
that all the works should be done for sacrifice
Now this could have been a revelation for most of us
because we have been taught to work in order to have self enjoyment, enjoy sense objects.
However, in order to have happiness we don't require to assimilate sense objects for our self enjoyment
rather the results of the work should be offered for the satisfaction of Krishna.
So all the offering, all the yajna, all the sacrifice that we can do
is classified we saw in previous classes
depending upon the social spiritual situation of the living entity in various categories.
There is sacrifice of hearing process, brahmacharis, there is sacrifice of the sense objects by the grahasthas
and there is sacrifice of material ingredients
there is sacrifice of the breathing process
pranayama, there is sacrifice of the activities of the senses
the patanjali, the yoga process, ashtanga yoga process
there is sacrifice of penance just like now we are observing chatur masya
so in these 4 months it would rain very heavily
ordinarily sannyasis are supposed to travel far and wide to preach
and in these 4 months because it rains so they cannot travel
so when they are not able to travel then they stay at one place during the rainy season
they are called chatur masya, the 4 months
and then wherever the sannyasis are staying they would stay in some local house
and then they would assemble all the people, all the villagers, all the people in the locality
and then they would preach Krishna consciousness and they would listen.
and very very strict vows are supposed to be observed by a person
and I request please pose the questions after the session
because many questions may get answered
and the questions which we discuss they should mainly be connected to the topic
because there are endless questions we can just keep on this thing
and if we hear the topic nicely we will get some questions
if you are not having questions connected to the topic it means either we
are not able to assimilate, we are not able to understand
or could be because of inattention also at times
so try to ask questions related to the session
and those questions will come after the session is over
so please post once we have discussed the subject matter
we have chanted the holy name
and yes if after that we have done the relevant enquiries about the session
if there are some other questions that also you can post not an issue
so during these four months of chatur masya, the rainy season
the sanyasis would stay at one place
and very very rigorous austerities they would perform
along with preaching to the local people
and the austerities are like you don't have to shave your beard
you have to not use your hands for eating
sometimes the food is just strewn on the floor
and they would directly eat it without using the hands
and nothing should be eaten for one sense gratification
very very simple food stuff
and so many other austerities are there for chatur masya
like this various austerities people performed in Vedic culture
and the purpose of this austerity could be the enjoyment of senses
it could be the knowledge of self
or it could be devotional service to Krishna
but tapasya is very important
so people do tapo yajna, people do gyan yajna, swadhyan yajna
reading the scriptures, literatures that is also sacrifice
so like this people engage in various sacrifice
and all these sacrifices can be classified into categories
Lord Krishna explains the sacrifice of material possessions
and sacrifice for transcendental knowledge
sacrifice of transcendental knowledge is spiritual activity
and sacrifice of material possessions may be spiritual
may be material activity
if I am sacrificing my property, my wealth, my possessions
my resources, my belongings
so that I can enjoy very nice next life
and there is a law if you give some money
Srimad Bhagavatam mentions
to an unqualified person
the same money would come back to you
your money is not, nobody can steal your money away from you
so if you have given to somebody
the same money would be returned in next life
given to unqualified person
and not just return
if the other person does not give that money to you in this life
then next life he has to return it four times
and you also have taken some money
you have to give it back, you cannot keep it
but if in this life you are not able to return
next life four times you have to give it back
so this is the law of nature
and if you give to a Brahmana who is qualified
then your money can return back
depending upon the qualification of Brahmana
if Brahmana is qualified maybe 10 times
more qualified 20-50 times or up to 100 times
that is why the charity was done to the Brahmanas
because the Brahmanas are in knowledge
and they want to use this money properly for Krishna service
and all the wealth is supposed to be owned by the Brahmanas
who are the representatives of Krishna
they will not hold anything for themselves
but they will use everything in Krishna service
suppose they get a lot of money
not that the Brahmanas would enjoy
eventually Brahmanas started enjoying
so Brahmanas became Shudras and the culture got lost
so Brahmanas will have money
somebody is coming and giving lakhs of rupees
they would take it
and then they would organize a very large festival
and then spend everything in the festival
feasting all the arrangements
and spend the money in Krishna service
so in this way if you give to a Brahmana
your money comes back
depending upon the qualification of Brahmana
if you give to Vaishnava, devotee of Krishna
then money comes back in unlimited proportions
and the person makes his spiritual life successful
goes back to Godhead
so this is how the money
just like in bank
in various kinds of deposits we have returns
so laws of nature also define
what kind of returns you are going to have
so some people
they sacrifice the material possessions
in order to have it
many folds in the next life
so if for this interest
they are doing sacrifice
then such sacrifices are material activity
however devotees as we also discussed
sacrifice the material possessions
in the service of Krishna
then such
Dravya Yajna, Dravya Mayajna
sacrifice of material possessions
becomes a spiritual activity
but the purpose of all the activities
whether you sacrifice your material possessions
or your sacrifice
is for knowledge
is ultimately to realize
the knowledge of self, the knowledge of God
and to have this knowledge
the very simple direct process
is given by Lord Krishna
you may keep on doing tapasya, penance
or Dravya Mayajna, keep on doing charity
it may take a very very long time
unless you are able to find a spiritual master
and ultimately you have to
find a spiritual master
Chaitanya Charita Amrita mentions
living entities doing these activities
life after life
the sacrifice starts with material possessions
ok let me do some good work
just like when people become very rich
they have enjoyed the senses nicely, name fame
but still they are not satisfied
so they start sacrificing
so that is called charitable activity
or Dravya Yajna
just like today we see the richest people of the world
they are pledging 50%, 90% of their wealth
or 99% of their wealth
so this is also sacrifice
they could have enjoyed all the money
but no they chose to sacrifice
by this sacrifice eventually
they will come to the platform
of doing penance
tapo mayajna
and then more purification
they will come to knowledge
and in this way
after so much sacrifices
gradual progression of sacrifices
he will realize
the importance of sense control
and life after life
once he is sufficiently purified
he is ready to get liberated
from the cycle of birth and death
then such a soul is able to meet a spiritual master
and then what he is supposed to do with spiritual master
pranipatayana
surrender completely 100%
spiritual master tells you lift your left hand
you lift your left hand
lift your left finger
lift your left finger
spiritual master tells to eat, you eat
master tells you eat this, you eat that
he tells you do not eat, you do not eat
he may give logical instructions
you follow, he may give illogical instructions
that also you follow
just like the example is there of lord chaitanya maha prabhu
so lord chaitanya maha prabhu
was
visiting south indian
srirangam temple
and chaitanya maha prabhu
when he went there
he saw brahmana
as i explained this story before to you also
but it's very very instructive
so chaitanya maha prabhu saw this brahmana
he was reading bhagavad gita upside down
and everyone
would make fun of him
and they would ask what are you reading brahmana
because they knowing
knowing that the brahmana was illiterate
and chaitanya maha prabhu also
asked brahmana what are you reading
and brahmana realized
this person is not
making fun of me
he is genuinely asking
so he told i am reading bhagavad gita
but actually
i do not know how to read bhagavad gita
so i am simply trying
why you are doing like that
because my spiritual master has ordered me
to read bhagavad gita everyday
so chaitanya maha prabhu
was very much pleased by this attitude
this person is illiterate
and suppose we are illiterate
and spiritual master tells us
so you should read bhagavad gita everyday
or suppose there is some chinese bhagavad gita
arabic bhagavad gita
and we are told to read that bhagavad gita everyday
it does not make any sense
an ordinary person may think
what spiritual master instruction is given
he does not know his disciple
that i do not know the language
why such an instruction is given
but an actual student
he has complete faith in the spiritual master
even though i cannot read this language
but my spiritual master
has told me to read so i will read
because simply having strong
faith in the spiritual master and krishna
is the secret of success
for advancement in spiritual life
so this brahmana did not speculate
and think
in the wrong way about his spiritual master
but he tried to follow
very sincerely the instruction
and then chaitanya maha prabhu
told oh so its ok that you are
trying to read that is very nice but why you are crying
because you cannot read
so brahmana told
when i see lord krishna
and this picture which is there on the cover of bhagavad gita
that the supreme personality
of godhead the owner of the three worlds
he has become servant of his devotee
then i am feeling some
emotions in the heart
and thus i am crying
seeing this wonderful reciprocation of lord
towards his devotee
and chaitanya maha prabhu became very pleased
so brahmana told you have realized bhagavad gita
so even by reading bhagavad gita very very nicely
a person may not understand
but if a person has such strong
faith in spiritual master that spiritual
master apparently has given an illogical
instruction but i want
to follow this instruction very nicely
so this is the secret
of success of spiritual life
and he was able to ultimately
from all the vedas from bhagavad gita
what has to be known
that lord krishna will explain today
we will see in the verse
that all the living entities we are part and
parcel of krishna and
we have eternal relationship with krishna
and that person was able to understand
this simply because he tried to follow
spiritual master very very sincerely
so all the processes
of various yajnas their end
is ultimately to get transcendental
spiritual knowledge and if a person
surrenders to spiritual master he can
shortcut the entire process
and make his life successful
in this very birth
simply by following such a pure
devotee and
it should not be blind searched
you can ask questions, surrender
ask questions and then
engage in service of that spiritual master
pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya
by this process
the spiritual knowledge is revealed to the
disciples
then lord krishna what he is going to
tell further let us see now
so what is this knowledge we understood
spiritual knowledge will be given
by tatvadarshina a pure
devotee spiritual master
when a sincere person
engages in his service
and in all humility he
puts forth enquiries by completely
surrendering himself
then upadekshanti te jnanam the spiritual
knowledge is revealed so what is
that knowledge which is revealed
that lord krishna explains here
text number 35
chapter 4
and when you have
thus learned the truth
you will know that all living
beings are but part of me
and that they are in me
and are mine
so when a person has learned
the truth from a spiritual master
what would be the result
what has he known actually
lord krishna is explaining
you will know that all living
beings are but part of me
that all living beings are but
part of me
means they are mine
they are in me and are mine
lord krishna is not telling
he will realize that i am
lord krishna no
they are mine
unfortunately people
wrongly understand the scriptures
and they present the understanding
that we are same as god
god is only existing in different form
and they tell there is something called
narayan seva
narayan has become daridrva you are going to the temple
to serve see the narayan is lying there
loitering on the street as a beggar
you engage in the service of beggar
and that is narayan seva
and then same sannyasis they tell
that no spiritual life and
material life
they are completely different things
food is matter
whatever food you want you eat
there is no relation between the food that you eat
and your spiritual life because matter and spirit
are different
and then such people they also support
meat eating
and they are also little famous in our country
so very very unfortunate
so pravapa told them you are telling
daridr narayan do seva of
you are seeing narayan in some beggar
or a wretched person
outside on the street who is suffering
that is all right
but if you believe in this philosophy
then why don't you do goat
narayan seva
why you are killing the poor goat in goat you are not seeing narayan
so if narayan has taken
all these forms of goat, cats, dogs
poor man, rich man
why you are only fond of serving the poor man
and why you are not serving that
goat rather you are killing the goat
so this is hypocrisy
so such people have no spiritual
realization and
just to get sentimental
people who are not
very intelligent and to appease the
masses and have some following
they put forth such philosophies
so there is no substance in such
philosophy because one side you are telling
that is narayan, poor man is narayan
he is suffering let me help him, another
narayan in the form of goat you are killing
so this philosophy does
not make any sense
however there are some people
sarvabhutahite rataha
they tell everyone is narayan so I will be
engaging in the service of all the living entities
I will
not kill animals, I will neither harm
hurt human beings
but then this philosophy
also is dangerous because they tell everyone
is narayan so that philosophy
is not approved by bhagavad gita
in bhagavad gita we can very clearly see
in this verse and many other verses also
krishna tells
this philosophy has greatly
plagued the country which is called the philosophy
of impersonalism
in this philosophy
they tell god is not a person
god is simply an energy and that energy
takes different forms
so all these forms are actually forms of god
that you are seeing around you
so you can imagine that energy in any form
you can imagine that energy has taken the form of
shiva, that energy has taken the form of durga
ganesha, surya
and any form because you have to
attach yourself to that spiritual energy
and attachment
without form is not possible
for us so you can imagine any form
and once you are spiritually advanced
realize that you are not the body then you can give
up that worship, you can give up your guru
also, so this is very
dangerous philosophy and not
approved by bhagavad gita
lord krishna tells in bhagavad gita
you are my ansha means
part
krishna is not telling you are me only
krishna is telling you are my ansha
all the living entities of this world
means eternally always
you are always a part, you will always
a part of me, you can never merge
people tell we have to go and merge in god
krishna is telling not possible
you will always remain my ansha
sometimes is misunderstood by people
as
shilaprabhupad gives example you see an
airplane is flying high in the sky in the daytime
after sometime we feel that
the airplane has merged in the sky
it has not merged, it maintains
its individuality
we are not able to see
parrot is there, it is
gone and it has entered some bush
or some tree because of the
green color it appears the parrot has
merged with the tree but it is not merged
it maintains its individuality
even the small molecules the water droplets
so many molecules are there they maintain
their individuality although it appears
like a collective water they are merged
they are together but they have their individuality
in a similar fashion
living entity may appear to be merged
just like an airplane in the sky or a parrot
in the tree but
they maintain their individuality
and that is asserted by lord krishna
and all the seers of truth in bhagavad gita
sarve vayam natvam nemi janadhipa
na chayavana bhavishya maha
janadhipa these kings you or me
arjuna, arjuna was thinking if I kill
these people they will not exist
so krishna is telling please do not think
natve vaham jatu na asam
there was never a time when
you me or these kings janadhipa were
not existing
na chayavana bhavishya maha bhavishya
in future also there won't ever be
a time that we would stop existing
sarve vayam
sarve vayam means plural in sanskrit
there is singularity, duality
and plurality
and krishna is telling
sarve vayam aham avam vayam
atah param
we are eternal so we will
always exist in future also
so this individuality is
not going to get finished
nobody was ever merged in god
nobody is ever going to merge again in god
we were always individuals, we are
individuals, we will be individuals in future
we will be ansha as lord krishna
tells again and in this shloka
again lord krishna is asserting the same fact
when you have realized the perfect
truth in this way by surrendering
serving asking a bona fide
spiritual master you will know
that all living entities are but part
of me
they are
in me and they are mine
just like
we the spirit soul are there
so we can understand everything
by understanding
yourself you can understand god
because you are sample of god, small ansha of god
so we are
spiritual spark within this body
and that spiritual spark
spreads itself in the form of
spiritual and when it is in the material
world, material energy
so this material energy it is our energy
we can lift our hand
we can take it up, we can bring it
down and the soul expands
itself as this material body
when it goes to spiritual world
it expands itself as spiritual body
and although the soul is one
but when it expand
expand itself in this body or
some other body in some other life
this body is also composed of various other
living entities, small living entities
each cell
of the body is having life
and there is
metabolism of the cell, there is cell growth
there is cell division just like
we produce young ones, the cells also
produce young cells and then
there is decay and there is death of the cell
same cycle what we undergo
birth, growth
maintenance, reproduction, dwindling
and vanishing, a cell also small
living entity goes through the same
cycle and all these
cells they are situated in my
energy, they are situated
in me, in a similar fashion
Krishna also expands himself as
spiritual and material energy
the liberated souls are situated in Krishna
spiritual energy and we conditioned
souls of this material world are
situated in Krishna's material energy
but everyone is situated in Krishna
always, we are
that is the meaning of they are in me
and our mind, we always belong to Krishna
so thus we should
read Bhagavad Gita very nicely
and not get attracted or allured
by a philosophy which tells you are only God
although that philosophy is appealing
to us conditioned souls because we have
come here to become God
we are in competition to become the greatest
we want to become center of attraction
but if we are seeking true knowledge
we should reach the authorized scriptures
and in scriptures such a philosophy
is never given any weightage
let us see the next
verse
even if you are considered
to be most sinful of all sinners
when you are situated in the boat of
transcendental knowledge, you will be able
to cross over the material of
over the ocean of miseries
all the miseries are because of sinful life
as we have discussed before
the laws of nature we break
so even if you are considered to be the most
sinful of all sinners
when you are situated on the boat of transcendental
knowledge, you will be able to cross
over the ocean of miseries
let us see next shloka, then I will explain this one
shloka
so the material activities
produce various reactions, some reactions
are good others are bad
so actually so called good reactions
are also bad because those actions
keep us back in the material world
so we are given some facilities for enjoyment
of senses however the miseries
remain as it is
birth, old age
disease and death
recently one of the top
IPS officers who was
also governor of couple of
provinces, he could not
continue his life
and committed suicide
and purportedly
he has admitted
in his note that I was
suffering because of bad
health
and similar statement was made by another
bureaucrat who was very very powerful
in Karnataka
and some of our devotees were in
touch with him, he helped us a lot
in various activities
and then he was in
Delhi because bureaucrats eventually
some of them they moved there
and we also started our activities
in Delhi so he called one of the senior
devotees that next time
if you are coming to Delhi
it will be very nice if you can grace our house with
your visit, so Prabhu told okay
yeah he is a good person devotee
let me go and meet
so the Prabhu went
and met that person and that
person he sat next to Prabhu
he held his hand and he told
can you please pray for me
Krishna will
listen to you soon, please pray
for me that I
don't
continue longer
in this life
so Prabhu told
oh why you are telling like that
and you are in a good
position you are a good man
you have lived a righteous life
you have been so very much powerful you are
in good position why you are telling
like this that you don't
wish to continue longer in this body
so then he explained that how
much he was suffering from various diseases
there was some pain in the back
and there is some chronic ulcer and there
are so many other things
and although he has good wife
and good
children it is alright which is
also difficult combination but somehow
the health is so bad in old age
he doesn't wish to continue
I don't wish to live any long please let me die
please pray to Krishna
so this old age is very very
pathetic situation
the more a person enjoys in his youth
hood especially sex
life so it is told in
bhagavatam and other places
that a person who enjoys
unlimited unrestricted
sex pleasure his old age is very very
pathetic and he dies a miserable death
so these things
people do not know
so then this person he told that
please pray for my death and the other
person we have read in the news
he himself succumbed to death
committed suicide
he could not tolerate bad health
very powerful person director of the
very powerful institution of the
country and people can
just aspire for this success
and somehow he was not satisfied
so what is the use of these
materialistic pursuits this is called
transcendental knowledge
so so called good activities
definitely he had done good activities
in previous life that is why he was able to
become director of such big institution and then
governor and then so many things
but despite all these good activities
these things will always
continue to exist birth is a misery
old age is a misery diseases are
miserable and death is great misery
so that is why
we have to get rid of good activities
and bad activities as well
so less intelligent people
want to be good in this world
and not to be bad
a real knowledgeable person
he neither wants to be good
or bad he wants to be devotee
transcendental he can give up
so called good activities also
just like the gopis give up good
activities in the service of Krishna
Maharaj Yudhishthir was supposed to
give up good activities of always being
truthful but he did not give up
did not obey Krishna's
instructions to
lie on the battlefield
then he was given punishment to see hell
why you didn't obey my
instruction I am the creator
I am the
giver of all the codes of law
and you want to stick to those
laws when lawmaker is directly giving you
some instructions you are supposed to follow that
so Yudhishthir Maharaj is pure devotee
of Krishna but by their example they want
to give us the teaching that when
supreme lawmaker is telling something that is
law
dharmam tu saakshad bhagvat pranitam
the instructions of God are called dharma
if you are not following the instructions
directly then you are adharmi
that is why the conclusion of Bhagavad
Gita is sarva dharmam parityajya
forget all the religious codes
conducts duties whatever are mentioned
mam ekam sharanam raja
surrender completely unto me
so that is why we have to give up
good activities if Krishna wants
we have to give up bad activities also
if Krishna wants we need to do
activities only which are pleasing
to the supreme personality of God
this is called sarva dharmam parityajya
forget all good and bad that you have
created in this material world just
surrender unto me completely
so neither good nor bad
because good activities also ultimately
are not able to solve the four main problems
of material existence
so this blazing as blazing fire
turns firewood to ashes
the fire of knowledge burns to ashes
all reactions of material activities
even if you are considered
the previous shloka told the greatest of the
sinners you are suffering
you are going to suffer in future very
very miserably but if you are
having transcendental knowledge
then immediately you are relieved
so some people are not
able to understand
so just like one of our
devotee he was doing book distribution
and he met a person who was
on a job hunt
so he asked so bhagavad gita solves all
the problems of life because that is how they preach
yes bhagavad gita will solve
all the problems of life and then he
asked so i am looking for a job so how
bhagavad gita will help me to find my job
problem to solve my job problem
so then this devotee
was little new in book distribution
he could not give a proper answer then he
asked me
so how bhagavad gita can solve all
the problems of life i may have this
problem that problem so many fields of
problems are there
so the beautiful example
is given in the scriptures
just like a man who is loitering on the
street suffering
hungry
you may take some sympathy with the
person and help him with some
money with some clothes or
some food that is called good work
but this kind of work
is not
solution of the
problems of that person
again he will become hungry and his
suffering will continue to exist
you cannot help anybody eternally here
so what is the best
service the best service is take
that person he has got a rich father
take that person to his father
his father is a rich man
he need not struggle for all these wants
simply if he lives his father
obediently then all his problems are solved
so this is
what is transcendental knowledge
when we have this knowledge
immediately we will realize
I belong to Krishna
Krishna is telling you are mine
you are my
just like the child is
father the child belongs to father
you are my child my son
and the father is willing to give all the
property to his child rather
father may live in a humble situation
but is willing to offer all the
comforts to his child
but the child should be obedient to the father
the child should live with father
not leave the father
this is the only expectation of father
in a similar fashion
Krishna has declared what is this
transcendental knowledge which you receive
from spiritual master
this knowledge is all of us belong to Krishna
my Krishna is declaring you are mine
so if I belong to God
I am eternal son of God
God is having all the powers of this world
all the richness all the opulence of this
world is controlled by God
you are willing to offer me all these things as inheritance
so I simply need to
connect back
revive my memory of my relationship with my father
supreme lord and start acting in that
relationship
if I am son of this rich man
let me act as son
if I am daughter of rich man let me act as daughter
if I am wife of a rich man
let me act as obedient wife
anybody who is connected to a rich man
in these relationships he will automatically enjoy
all the richness and property
Krishna is sacchidananda, Krishna is sat
Krishna is eternal
Krishna is chit full of knowledge and ananda
Krishna is full of pleasure
so anybody who comes in contact with Krishna
he starts acting in his relationship
eternal relationship
which we forget now in this body
then that living entity also becomes eternal
also becomes full of knowledge
and full of bliss
a person who has money can only give money
and Krishna is sacchidananda
he is eternal, full of knowledge
and full of bliss
so all these offerings are given to the living entity
we have all these offerings
but we have forgotten
so we have to realize it simply
that I belong to Krishna
so Krishna is willing to offer me everything
the liberated living entity
they get saarupya mukti
the same form, same beauty as Krishna
they get sarshti mukti
they become equally opulent as that of Krishna
their same opulence
their same power
sometimes Krishna gives more power to his devotees
than what he has
Yashoda
she is binding Krishna with ropes
so supreme personality is being
controlled by a living entity
Arjuna is directing Krishna
take my chariot left right forward in the middle
so sometimes Krishna
agrees to get controlled even by his
devotees, what to speak of equal power
he gives greater power
so this is spiritual knowledge
so that is why
as soon go all the problems are completely solved
by the mercy of spiritual
master we execute the devotional
process nicely and when he is merciful
when Krishna is merciful
this knowledge doesn't remain just theory
but this knowledge is awakened in the heart
practically a person realizes
I am part and parcel of Krishna
and then immediately all his problems are solved
so this is how Bhagavad Gita
helps us to solve all the problems of life
we need not
go for some temporary solutions
this particular life and death will come
take everything away
but rather
we have to simply realize my father is there
he is eternal, I am also eternal
I need not die over and over again
simply I have to revive this
transcendental knowledge
revive my relationship with
my unique father
my eternal father the supreme lord
however
Lord Krishna mentions
In this world
there is nothing so sublime
as pure and as transcendental knowledge
such knowledge is the mature
fruit of all mysticism
and one who has achieved this
enjoys the self within himself
in due course of time
naturally when you know
that this person is your relative
then you are able to enjoy
so much with that person
you may meet anybody
who is going to become your future relative
who is going to become your future relative but you may not enjoy so much
unless the relationship is established similarly we have to re-establish or
revive the relationship which we have with God now we have forgotten so we
don't enjoy any pleasure but when this knowledge is revived knowledge of my
relationship with Krishna I belong to Krishna then the living entity enjoys
the self within himself in due course of time there is no need of any other
enjoyment but what is the qualification Lord Krishna mentions
a faithful man who is absorbed in transcendental knowledge and who
subdues his senses quickly attains a supreme spiritual peace so actually we
are looking for that supreme spiritual peace that is attained by a person who
is absorbed in transcendental knowledge but a person should be faithful for
this so this faith is very very important criteria and as we have seen
before ultimately from all the processes this faith has to be increased so if a
person is faithful he is absorbed in transcendental knowledge then he can
attain supreme spiritual peace so somebody may ask then what is this faith
this faith we read everywhere we have to be faithful we have to be faithful what
does it mean that I am faithful yes I have faith in Krishna and every Sunday
or every Ekadashi or maybe every day I visit God or I have God in my own
place I see him I bathe him every day offer him something to eat so I am
having faith in God and I am engaged in service of God but then I don't get this
peace I am still disturbed in life so how do we understand what is this faith
what is this faithful man so this definition of faith is given in Shri
Chaitanya Charita Amrita Shraddha faith is defined as Shraddha in Sanskrit
Shraddha Shabde Sudhra Vishwasa Hoya Krishna Bhakti Kaila Sarva Karma Krith Hoya
so Prabhupada asked his disciples this question so what does it mean having
faith in Krishna so disciples asked disciples told that Prabhupada faith
means having faith that Krishna is supreme personality of Godhead
Prabhupada told you have faith or you do not have faith Krishna will remain supreme
personality of Godhead so what is the meaning of having faith so then
devotees told no faith means Krishna is a person Krishna is a personality
Krishna is a person he will always remain a person what is the meaning of
this faith so then Prabhupada gave this definition of faith from Shri Chaitanya
Charita Amrita Krishna Bhakti Kaila Sarva Karma Krith Hoya Shraddha Shabde Sudhra
when a person is having very strong conviction conviction in what Krishna
Bhakti Kaila if I engage in service of Krishna Sarva Karma Krith Hoya then all
the duties are successfully performed this is called faith and people till no
I have to do all these duties then I will surrender to Krishna in old age just
like if you chant more number of rounds some of your friends and relatives can
point out now you are supposed to do this task and then this devotional
service to take up later maybe in old age and we are also faithful but not
this much that this much time we should spend so this is not faith faith means
Krishna Bhakti Kaila if I am engaged in the service of Krishna all the duties
are automatically performed Sarva Karma Krith Hoya I need not do anything else
this is called faith as long as a person is not on this platform he's not called
a faithful man and a spiritual life does not begin does not start spiritual
life starts from this point only service of Krishna Sarva Karma Krith Hoya then
everything is successful if so-called duties are in alignment with Krishna
seva I can pick up those duties and if those so-called duties are against
Krishna service I will give up those duties just like the injunction is there
in the scripture so scriptures are very important sometimes the situation can be
that a son is there and the father is being attacked in front of the child
and the father can die so what a son should do and the son knows if I go to
save my father I will be killed so should the son think let me save myself let me
take care of my family members because father is anyway going to die
or should you think let me grow strong and tomorrow when I grow up I become
powerful I'll take revenge with these people I'll kill them later
or now somehow you should try to protect even though he is not he knows he'll not
be able to protect what is the course of action which should be taken
so logically speaking a person cannot come to proper conclusion or he may come
to wrong conclusion that okay at least only two people are there in the house
family has to be taken care so son should try to protect himself at least to take
care of family but the vedas tell no this is not the law son will suffer like that
if he takes such a decision if the father is being attacked son has to lay down his
life before anything happens to the father even though his death is sure
similarly kshatriya kshatriya knows I am going to die but he is never
expected to leave and show his back to the enemy he should take the blow on his chest
if a kshatriya dies in this way then next life he is promoted to heavenly planets
so we should not just see the results of this life because we are eternal
in this life we may lose something next life the gain is going to be great if
you follow the laws so does the law is if the son is there before the father
then he's supposed to lay down his life before anything happens to the father
so this is duty of a son but if we see the example of a great devotee prahlad maharaj
who is one of the greatest authorities of spiritual knowledge
again his father is being attacked and beaten very badly he's going to be killed
and he's eventually killed but did not take any action what to speak of fighting with the killer
of his father is standing with a garland in his hands and then he's telling that
my dear lord please don't become angry you please give up your anger
even the saintly persons are happy when a snake or scorpion is killed
so my father was like a snake or scorpion without any reason he was envious of everyone
so that is why nobody is unhappy because of this death please give up your anger
so he's calling like that his father and he's garlanding the killer of his father he's going
against the rule of the scriptures this is called this is totally against dharma
similar thing was done by bali maharaj bali maharaj gave up his spiritual master and he
was cursed so giving a spiritual master is very bad activity most sinful activity but bali maharaj
gave up because this dharma was against serving krishna so he gave up spiritual
master he did so-called adharma pralad maharaj did so-called adharma by garlanding the killer
of his father so this is the sublime instruction of bhagavad gita in the vedas
wanted to train his son pralad as a very great king expert in economics politics and all other
affairs but palad maharaj and he told give up your devotional service but he did not
give up did not listen to father ideally a person is supposed to listen to father without putting
any logic as soon as lord ramchandra was told by his father to go to jungle he did not argue
immediately left he did not tell father your handbag similarly simply some servant has
put something in the ears of my mother and then unintelligent decision you are taking
but he did not argue father has told something that has to be done followed in all the respects
spiritual master and father if they tell something that order has to be carried out
a person should not deny this is the dharma but pralad maharaj he did not follow
so this is called faith we have to develop this strong faith if i just engage myself in service
of krishna all other dharma duty everything is performed very nicely so this faith is required
so a faithful man when a person has this faith and he's absorbed in transcendental knowledge
and one more thing is required what is that subdues his senses
so subduing senses is always very important then a person can attain supreme spiritual peace
nowadays all of us are letting lose our senses entire economic development means just let your
lenses senses more and more lose while you're sleeping at night keep on watching movies eat
more eat anything and everything anywhere wear anything and everything anywhere whatever you
want inside the house outside the house any activity anytime any place you can do
let lose your senses and thus we can see clearly so who tells bhagavad-gita is fiction we can see
sense enjoyment has increased and depression anxiety stress is also increased so you have
to control the senses you have to live a simple lifestyle when you are living a very very simple
lifestyle barely maintaining body and soul together then you will be most happy happiness
is inversely proportional to sense enjoyment directly proportional to sense enjoyment
directly proportional to krishna sense enjoyment
but probably it is very difficult to have such a faith that krishna bhakti kailay and this thing
so how to have this faith to pravapada is answering
one is called a faithful man who thinks that simply by acting in krishna consciousness he
can attain the highest perfection do not think you will lose something oh if i chant this much
then my boss will not be happy my other colleague he'll produce more and better
reports than me he'll get better promotion and thus i will lose in my life i will lose some marks
in my life i may lose on relationships nothing is lost highest perfection is achieved in all
respects by engaging in service of krishna so this faith is attained how by discharge of
devotional service seva ya so that is why seva is very very important so i was discussing with
one devotee that prabhu how did you become brahmachari sometime back and how you came
in touch so you explained in this way i came in touch and actually nobody told me to become
brahmachari and i did not read many books also some small books other books i had read
but then i was very rigorously engaged in serving krishna so automatically i told
i want to become brahmachari only i want to follow this path and today is very nice devotee
serving very nicely sincerely so there won't be any need even to tell you or tell somebody that
you please again not that everyone has to become brahmachari brahmachari grahastha vanaprastha
wherever you are situated so nobody needs to tell you that surrender to krishna completely
but automatically this knowledge will be awakened from the heart when we engage in
devotional service of krishna and unless a person engages in service you may finish
nothing will happen basic realization will not happen in life so this faith is attained please
note sevaya our lord krishna is mentioned in 4.34 same thing prabhupada is reiterating by
discharge of devotional service doing devotional service is important and along with seva
prabhupada is mentioning and by chanting chanting is also very important seva
so this specific seva is also important which cleanses one's heart of material dirt
and one more thing over and above this one should control the senses
so if you are chanting very nicely if you are doing seva also nicely but for
regulatory principles you are breaking senses are not under control then again we will remain
always under confusion clarity will not come in life because it is addiction we are indulging
in material addictions so we have to engage in service of krishna very nicely rigorously
chant Hare Krishna maha mantra and over and above this
lord krishna is mentioned here one should control his senses controlling senses means
following four regulatory principles very very strictly so when we do this thing automatically
this faith will come nobody has to come externally until and if a person is indulging in all these
breaking regulatory principles and not doing seva how much ever a person can speak it doesn't
strike us the spiritual instruction so in this way we can develop this faith and when we have
this faith then the result is very quickly not for a long time so this bhakti yoga is so very powerful
for a regular process of yoga prabhupada explained to his disciples valmiki did 60,000
vishwamitra also did 60,000 years of tapasya and prabhupada told the same advancement of 60,000
years a person can have in one week of sankirtana so this sankirtana mission is so very powerful
so and anybody can become faithful somehow or the other if a person is able to develop faith he is
able to surrender engage in seva very nicely control senses very soon in a matter of few
days as some of you would have realized that you are very new in krishna consciousness you do not
know much even without faith chaitanya charitamrita says this sadhana bhakti so powerful the process of
these rules and regulations what has been given to us this sadhana bhakti so powerful especially
the five elements chanting the holy names hearing bhagavatam associating with devotees
living in the holy place
and there is one more element in that
hearing bhagavatam living in the holy place deity worship
yes so if a person engages in either of these five elements even without faith he can perceive
the presence of lord very soon very quickly he attains supreme spiritual peace so an extraordinary
process has been given to us ordinarily it takes many many lifetimes thousands of years
but if a person is faithful he follows this process nicely very quickly in a matter of
days he attains the supreme spiritual peace it depends upon us how eagerly we want to apply
ourselves to this process so this is the destination of a faithful man very quickly not for a long time
achirena achirena achirena means long achirena means very quickly he will attain supreme
spiritual peace and agnyascha ashraddhadhanascha sanshayatma vinasyati nayamlokosthina paro na sukham
sanshayatmana so it was so unfortunate to hear some people are telling atheist is not a spiritualist
and theist is also not a spiritualist why because both are convinced about something
some knowledge if you are convinced about something that means you are not a spiritualist
spiritual life means always keep on questioning questioning questionings and searching searching
searching how foolish always remain skeptical always remain doubtful so foolish krishna is telling
what is the destination of a doubtful man second line vinasyati sanshayatma vinasyati he is destroyed
a person who is doubtful so lord krishna mentions ignorant and faithless persons who doubt the
revealed scriptures do not attain god consciousness for the doubting soul there is happiness neither
in this world nor in the next so this material world is dukkhalayam as we discussed even after
doing good activities having name fame money success a person is in stress so if you are working
hard thinking that by doing some adjustment i'll become happy we can please remove this eliminate
this thought completely from our mind rest assured we are never going to be happy in this world on
material platform we have to change the platform because lord krishna is telling dukkhalayam i have
created this world as dukkhalay as abode of miseries so if you are thinking by engaging in
some relationship with any person in this world i'll be happy if i marry this person i go away
from this person i save somebody i kill somebody i'll be happy by killing a goat i'll be happy by
saving my dog i'll be happy by doing this job getting this promotion i'll be happy please see
from your life your personal experience also by doing all these endeavors for five ten eight fifteen
twenty sixty seventy years are we happy that is the law of this world we can never be happy
and for the doubting soul sheila prabhupada explains he is even more unhappy anyway the
world is full of unhappiness dukkhalayam on material platform a doubting soul remains more
miserable in this miserable world so that is why a person who is doubtful who is faithless
for him there is no no help faith is required everywhere as we discussed doctor you have to
surrender he will cut open your heart do surgery but we have to surrender find a doctor if a person
is always doubtful doctor may not kill me doctors are dishonest they will take out kidneys then he
will keep on suffering from the disease chronic disease when he puts faith in doctor agreed 90
percent of doctors are corrupt they may charge excess money but there is no other way find a
good doctor and surrender so maximum spiritualist so-called spiritualists are cheaters agreed
but nevertheless you have to find a genuine spiritualist spiritual master without surrendering
there is no relief so krishna is telling for doubting soul there is happiness neither in this
world nor in the next world in the next life perpetually he will remain unhappy so this is
very wrong philosophy always remain skeptical doubtful krishna is telling i am giving you
definite knowledge when krishna is definitely ascertaining it means krishna is also not a
spiritualist krishna is a materialistic person krishna is clearly telling this is god this is
soul this is jiva so please don't fall for all such philosophies so a faithful person attains
supreme spiritual space by doing seva chanting and controlling the senses doubtful soul is more
miserable in this miserable world therefore one who is renounced the fruits of his action whose
doubts are destroyed by transcendental knowledge and is situated firmly in the self is not bound
by works or conqueror of riches so krishna tells arjuna so please act but renounce the fruits of
your activities because ultimately fruits will not bring you happiness when you give up the fruits
for krishna you will get transcendental knowledge that will give you happiness so if you are giving
up the results of your activities and you get transcendental knowledge by which your doubts
are destroyed then you will not be sinful for any kind of killing that you do on this battlefield
therefore the doubts which have arisen in your heart out of ignorance should be slashed by the
weapon of knowledge armed with yoga o bharta stand and fight so thus krishna has concluded
please do not stop doing activity fearing that you will have some sinful reaction no because you are
doing this activity as a sacrifice for me you will be giving up the results of this war also for my
satisfaction please rest assured you will not get any sin if you do any activity for the
satisfaction of krishna then we are not bound by any sinful reaction this is the conclusion of this chapter
