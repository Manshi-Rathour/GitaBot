so somebody gives us two options of improving our looks first option he
tells I will do very nice makeup of yours I'll apply the best things the
natural ingredients and very amazing stuff and you look very bright and
another person gives option that I will do something that your skin automatically
without any external application will become very good very bright which
option shall we prefer can you please write in the chat box because she on
is showing second second second one second one oh everyone second nobody
wants the first thing Nikhil Akash Robin Jyothi Mahek Sai okay thank you so much
so this new thing I have learned so they were telling how to engage people I came
something in a zoom call a zoom webinar so they tell please engage people you
ask some questions and they will first is very boring yes definitely and they
will put some answers on the chat and like this various other means of
engagement are there which people have they apply online and offline and people
give various seminars how to have yeah thank you so much now done now let us
hear this stuff so various people give various methods and techniques to
convince people to influence people to connect with people so when devotee was
giving example that one of his friends he visited our temple and he was an
atheist and somehow Prabhu engaged him in distributing some books and passes
for our sessions that we have just like we are having this one so he started
distributing distributing the passes so this friend he wondered that why you are
doing this service you are atheist and you're distributing passes for a
session so he's telling no I'm checking my marketing skills even though I don't
believe in this how well can I market this I can sell it off to others so
marketing is very important if you want to succeed in life ultimately we have to
market ourselves whether you have to get a job you have to apply in some college
especially invest in colleges or you have to get yourself married you have to
market yourself so like this people have figured out various techniques of
influencing people marketing selling of things connecting with people and if we
see Sheila Prabhupada when he went abroad he also was on this very important
mission and it was at this time that Prabhupada reached Boston Prabhupada took
almost a month around 35 days he traveled from India to Boston and I
think yesterday Prabhupada reached Boston in 1965 America so people tell that you
have to be very very confident you have to think that you are a billionaire you
think you imagine and there are many secrets and many book on the secret
principle that universe is your servitor your order is the command of the
universe it will fulfill you just think you just imagine it is going to happen
I'm already successful I have thousands of followers I'm already a billionaire
and people do imagine like that and people keep high aspirations think of
hundred percent so at least you will hit on 98 99 percent but Sheila Prabhupada
you can please read wonderful prayers are there maybe we'll share in the
telegram group also marketing Bhagavad Dharma preaching Krishna consciousness
in America so how Prabhupada is very beautifully writing down the prayers
Sheila Prabhupada is mentioning I don't know Krishna why you have brought me
here so people here are full of when Prabhupada he visited the Boston he got
down at the port and Prabhupada saw people are completely full of rajas and tamas
here so it is not possible for them to understand Krishna consciousness so you
told how will I make them understand people are completely in rajaguna and
tamoguna here passion and ignorance not possible to understand Krishna
consciousness so he told I'm like a puppet in your hand Krishna you make me
dance the way you want and then Prabhupada after composing these wonderful
prayers at the end he writes insignificant bigger so this is the
mood people tell that you have to have very high self-esteem think that you are
very great successful when you are giving a public talk the way to why stage
fear is think people are fools they do not know you have knowledge then you
will not have any stage fright but here Prabhupada is writing insignificant
bigger this is the mood of devotee and when Prabhupada went there he had a visa
permission for a month and Prabhupada was not having any money with him 40 rupees
that to Indian currency you cannot use it there but he was having Shrimad
Bhagavatam books with him he carried around 200 sets this was Prabhupada's faith
my spiritual master has told me to print and publish and distribute books so that
is what I'm going to do so he went to America practically penniless only with
some cartons of books trunks of books Bhagavatam sets and how Prabhupada
managed when Prabhupada got down at the Boston port immediately Prabhupada sold
one set to the captain and his wife they took in good spirits they were good
people this is how Prabhupada was personally selling books distributing
books Bhagavatam and he thought now Prabhupada got a sponsorship for a month
and then Prabhupada told a month I have got sponsorship maybe one more month I can
continue and I think maximum I can survive here for two months beyond that
what will happen so then he told they asked him how long do you wish to stay
he told two months I will stay and then after two months Prabhupada was always
asking when is the next ship going back Prabhupada was not very hopeful that how
people will pick up Krishna consciousness even though the speaker is
very very potent but the other person is dull he has no inquisitiveness he will
not he will not understand so Prabhupada was always checking when is the next
ship going back next ship going back and he kept on postponing one more month two
more months and after one year they told no more extension no more visa so
Prabhupada was always thinking that it is my Guru Maharaj's order so I have to
fulfill it although Prabhupada got two heart attacks when he was traveling
around Janmashtami day but still Prabhupada continued so my spiritual
master is told to come here and try to spread Krishna consciousness so it is my
duty to go and try to spread people may pick up people may not pick up we are
not concerned with people but let me fulfill the order of my Guru Maharaj
this is the secret of spiritual advancement so this Prabhupada was doing
like this and when Prabhupada was talking to people he defied all the norm of all
the principles that people follow for influencing the masses and this thing
keep an eye contact have gestures use the stage no use Prabhupada would either
stand at the mic or sit down they tell you have eye contact no eye contact
Prabhupada is practically sometimes his eyes are completely closed he is
meditating upon Krishna and he is giving lectures and they tell you polish your
communication polish your accent and so many other things Prabhupada's accent was
that of an old man that to Bengali laden English accent and sometimes people were
not able to make out what he's speaking so one devotee many devotees were
telling and one devotee practically tells that in his university there were
flyers around that the founder of Hare Krishna movement is coming by that time
Hare Krishna movement gains a momentum so he told okay let me go in here the
founder is coming these people are seen everywhere all their ports all the
cities all the malls is Hare Krishna people are everywhere who is the founder
what is this thing happening across the world so then he went and then Prabhupada
was speaking again very heavily this accent he was not able to make out what
Prabhupada spoke but simply by hearing Prabhupada's transcendental Vani voice he
got convinced whatever this man is telling I need to follow him I just want
to follow this man and then he became a full-time devotee in the movement so
this was Prabhupada's influence so Prabhupada did not do any material calculations we see
he was not very expectant very confident my Guru Maharaj has told you go so it is
my duty to go and see result is in Krishna's hands if he wants to make it
successful it will be successful so that is why the secret of success in
spiritual life is not some material adjustment whole world is doing material
adjustment and the result of this material adjustment is more and more
material complications Hiranyakasipu did lot of material calculations I should
not be killed in daytime nighttime this thing that thing his small son Prahlad
defied all the calculations his father is the most powerful man of the universe
the demigods are scared of him and he knows if I don't follow my father
anything can happen to me but he was sticking to the devotional service of
Krishna he did not follow his father's advice his death was sure but he was
saved and father got killed instead so thus devotee does not rely upon his
material calculation he simply tries to follow the principle set down by
God by Krishna and thus we see they always come out successful so that is
why some of you may wonder why we don't make it interactive why we don't take
questions in between so that is why Prabhupada told the realization when we
hear spiritual discourses it happens by hearing them with rapt attention that's
it even though a person does not understand the language but if the here
is eager and the speaker is bona fide if we hear with rapt attention then
spiritual realization happens now this rapt attention is not easy at many
people asked in the past also Prabhupada it is difficult my mind goes here and
there while hearing lectures so that is why we tell please hear let this bhajan
that we play kirtan or do chanting take bath in the evening and then you hear
the lecture regulate your eating sleeping other things so our attention
will improve when we are very regulated in eating sleeping meeting defending in
our lifestyle with discipline comes attention rapt attention so that is why
we don't take questions comments in between so that you can hear without any
disturbance with rapt attention so that's Prabhupada told any questions at
the end not in between like that at the end we can have discussion so that is
why we had something in the beginning but then now we will have at the end so
all of you are telling that I want to go for the second option so just like we
discussed sometimes in the class and we discussed last time also four years a
person is spending for cracking an examination or many many years people
spend in education and why do we criticize all these things then what
would a person do what is wrong in that the wrong is time is limited efforts a
person can put either for doing makeup or improving his natural beauty one is
artificial temporary another is eternal everlasting so Lord Krishna tells now
another let us have another important interaction so all those people who have
come in touch during the covert times you have been hearing Bhagavad-gita we
have covered three chapters and before that nine chapter also we covered in
that since four chapters so if somebody asks you you have been hearing
Bhagavad-gita what is the essence of Bhagavad-gita then what will you tell
please write the essence of Bhagavad-gita in one or two lines that that
that's it not more than that one or two lines the essence of Bhagavad-gita we are
the soul not the body Aryan is telling surrender to Lord Krishna do your duty
without expecting any result we are the part and parcel of Krishna being
conscious of Krishna surrender to Krishna man-mana-bhaumad-bhakto we are
part and parcel of God surrender to Lord follow Krishna's instructions always
thinking of Krishna whatever we do only for Krishna very nice yawn the way of
living life nice pooja Mataji eternal servant of Krishna very good Himanshu
Prabhu everything is God basic of life always think about Krishna become his
devotee worship him offer obeisances being selfless knowledge the way of
living life devotional service okay thank you so much thank you so much thank
you so much so when Srila Prabhupada asked this question disciples gave
almost all the similar answers and everything is right whatever you have
given here most of you I mean whatever I could read here many many comments have
come so Srila Prabhupada told them the essence of Bhagavad-gita is that three
words we are eternal now this is most important thing which people do not
understand this is the essence of Bhagavad-gita which Bhagavad-gita wants
us to teach that we are eternal we are not these bodies we are completely
different from body some people may understand it in theory but there is no
realization when a realization is there when the understanding with conviction
is there then a person becomes a Brahmana Brahmabhuta prasannatma na
shocati na kanksati becomes Brahmabhuta prasannatman becomes completely happy
there is no lamentation in life and there is no hankering in life because he
understands because I am not this body made up of matter nothing made up of
matter is going to satisfy me and he does not hanker after anything because
he understands people are working very hard hankering for temporary things and
all the effort that we put if it is for temporary gain what is the use because
I'm eternal in this human form of life every moment is valuable now I can put
efforts for temporary gain or eternal gains so if you understand the essence
of Bhagavad-gita that we are eternal we should try to utilize every moment for
our eternal gain that is why people want to have their own house rather than
giving money on rent let me have my own house there is permanent asset
temporary house anybody can throw me out anytime so that is why every moment
should be utilized for putting efforts in our eternal life we are eternal so we
have to realize this essence of Bhagavad-gita so let us start with today's
verses they are going to very much do with the topics which we have discussed
and post that we will take up the questions
so I hope all of you are able to see this text number four in the previous
text Krishna explained to Arjuna evam parampara praptam imam rajarshaya vidhu
I spoke this knowledge to Sun God imam vivasvate yogam Sun God spoke to Manu
Manu spoke to Manu Manu vivasvan spoke to Manu his son Manu spoke to
Ikshavaku evam parampara praptam in this way in this parampara this knowledge
comes down the perfect knowledge of life knowledge of God knowledge of self you
cannot do by research work because we are completely influenced by this bodily
concept of life we are living in illusion that I am this body so to
understand reality we cannot take help of this body we have to take knowledge
from the creator himself does the creator creates guru shishya parampara
he gives knowledge to his disciple his disciple in this way the knowledge flows
down in parampara we understood so Arjuna here is putting forth a very
intelligent question Arjuna is asking
Arjuna said the Sun God vivasvani senior by birth to you how am I to
understand that in the beginning you instructed the science to him so this is
very intelligent question if I tell that I spoke this knowledge to Maharana
Pratap so somebody may ask Prabhu Maharana Pratap he came how many hundreds
of years ago and how can you speak this knowledge to him that is what Arjuna is
asking Sun God vivasvani senior by birth to you and we are friends so how am I
to understand that in the beginning you instructed the science to him who is
much much more senior millions of years senior to you so how to understand this
Krishna is telling I told this knowledge to vivasvani how can you tell somebody
here appeared after him so let us see what Lord Krishna answers
The Blessed Lord said many many births both you and I have passed I can remember all of them but you cannot oh subduer of the enemy
so here Lord Krishna begins to reveal transcendental knowledge
why Bhagavad Gita is so important so many books of knowledge are there
because Lord Krishna tells here many many births both you and I have passed
Arjuna is also eternal Lord Krishna is also eternal but this knowledge is
important because it is given by Krishna himself whose nature although he is also
eternal it is completely different from infinitesimal eternal souls who are
prone to forgetfulness so Krishna tells I can remember all of them but you cannot
subdue of the enemy so the spirit soul is eternal as we have seen in second
chapter also just like we change clothes we keep on changing
bodies and the law of this nature because we want to remain in illusion
I want to enjoy independent of God I want to become God in this world this is
our desire so I cannot accept that somebody is eternally God so in order to
facilitate this enjoyment God becoming tendency knowledge of God is not revealed
to living entities and thus he thinks I am this body only
so such a soul usually by laws of nature as soon as he takes another body he will
forget of all the happenings of previous body but Krishna he remembers all the
births because he is not changing the bodies so that Krishna will reveal here
now
although I am unborn and my transcendental body never deteriorates
and although I am the Lord of all sentient beings I still appear in every
millennium in my original transcendental form
so Lord Krishna is explaining here although I am unborn
and my transcendental body
means without deterioration
Krishna's body never deteriorates
means controller or master Lord
although I am the Lord of all sentient beings I still appear in every
millennium
I come here in my original transcendental form
so some people tell if you read that is why it is very important to receive
Bhagavad Gita in parampara they tell not to Krishna we have to surrender to the
person who is living within Krishna
so these people do not understand even the basic concepts of Bhagavad Gita
here Krishna is telling
although I am unborn and my transcendental body never deteriorates
it is not that Krishna leaves his body and then Krishna is living within the
body and then the body is dead and then Krishna the soul moves to another body
it is not like that
Krishna is telling my body never deteriorates because my body is
completely spiritual for us there is a difference between body and us
however for Krishna the Vedas mention
Dehi and Deha are two terms in Sanskrit
Deha means body we all know that
Dehi means the dweller of the body
Bhed means difference
Vidyate means exists, Ishwara means supreme Lord
such a difference does not exist in the supreme Lord
there is no difference between the soul of the supreme Lord
and the body of the supreme Lord
he is completely spirit inside and outside
he did not pick up a material covering in order to come here
that is done by living entities like us
we take up different coverings
we keep on forgetting the activities of previous covering
as we take up new coverings
so Krishna is telling I am unborn
and my transcendental body never deteriorates
thus although Krishna
we see that he was child then he grew
but once he became young
he always remained young
during the war of Kurukshetra
Krishna had sons and grandsons also
so his age was 125
he lived for 125 years on this planet
so although he was supposed to be very very old
125 years man
but Krishna never became old
his body never became old
he always appeared like a young boy
20 to 25 years
so thus we can understand
Krishna's body was transcendental
always, how much ever age is passing
in the number of years
the appearance of his body is unchanged
always young
Navayava Namcha
thus it is told in the glorification of Krishna
and Krishna here is using very wonderful word
Krishna is telling
Ajo api san
Aja means unborn
I am unborn
but how do we understand
because Krishna took birth
Krishna is the son of Devaki
thus sometimes people ask
that Prabhu how you are telling
Krishna takes various avataras
and Lord Ramachandra
all other they are expansions
avataras of Krishna
Krishna came later
Lord Ramachandra came first
and Lord Vishnu is always before that
how you are telling Lord Vishnu
is expansion of Krishna
so how to understand this
Krishna took birth from Devaki
they are father and mother
we all know that
in the prison house of Kansa
he took birth
but Krishna is telling here
I am unborn
I do not take birth
so how to solve this contradiction complexity
that Lord Krishna is going to answer
so Krishna is telling
so what religion
which religion
Hindu religion
Muslim religion
Sikhism
Christianity
Buddhism
XYZ
no
religion means
the rules and regulations
which are meant to elevate a person
to spiritual understanding
sometimes people think
this religion is all blind face
so many rules and regulations
but you have to understand
which kind of people
are implementing these rules
and regulations in society
the seekers of truth
why they will introduce something
in blind faith
they are doing research
after what is truth in life
so all these rules and regulations
the meaning we may understand
we may not understand
if we follow these very very religiously
very strictly
then by following these practices
a person rises to the understanding
that I am not this body
and then a person is not at all
disturbed by the changes of the body
so when there is decline
in religious practice
such rules and regulations
by which our spiritual status
can be revived
can be reclaimed
Krishna comes here to establish that
it is not that Krishna
only takes birth in
the land of India
what we call it
Krishna takes birth on various planets
in various forms
sometimes he may come directly
sometimes he can send his son
his close associates
also to spread this knowledge
but the knowledge is distributed
as per the time
place circumstances
and capacity of the individuals
like Lord Buddha
is also incarnation of Krishna
but Buddha did not discuss Vedic philosophy
because at that time
people were wrongly interpreting
the Vedas to kill the animals
no Vedas it is recommended
we should kill animals
and do Bali
and mass slaughter was happening
so people wrongly understood the Vedas
so that is why Krishna
had to come in the form
of Lord Buddha
and he told people
you reject the Vedas
because it was not possible
for them to understand
to understand Vedas
you need to have
very very controlled
mind and senses
so because it was not possible
for them to have it
Lord Buddha told you
reject it
and increase common sense philosophy
at least become
non-violent in the beginning
then you discuss the higher things
so like this
many many religions
bona fide religions
have been given by Krishna
or the associates of Krishna
but as per the time
place circumstance
and capacity of the individuals
however
here Arjuna is a
close associate of Krishna
friend of Krishna
and Lord Krishna
also will declare Arjuna
gyanam te ham savig gyanam
idam maksyami asheshetaha
now I am going to declare
this knowledge in
complete fullness
yaj gyaatva neha bhuya anyad
if you know this knowledge
nothing further
remains to be known
in future
so because Arjuna
is very close
associate of God himself
and he is completely
surrendered
please teach me
what do you want to teach
what do I do in life
people are not surrendered
they are not in need of knowledge
but still God comes
and tries to teach them
so he is not able to
give complete knowledge
as Lord Jesus Christ
preaching bona fide love of God
he told there are many things
I cannot tell you
because you cannot bear them now
that he clearly told
but here Lord Krishna
is telling
I am giving you
complete knowledge now
nothing further
remains to be known
all the principles
I have clearly explained here
so whenever and wherever
people forget
such religious practices
which are meant
to revive the eternal
position of the
living entity
Lord Krishna comes here
sambhavami yogey yogey
paritranaaya sadhunaam
vinashaya chadushkritam
dharma sanstha panarthaya
sambhavami yogey yogey
in order to deliver
and to annihilate
the miscreants
as well as to re-establish
the principles of religion
I admit myself
millennium after millennium
so some people ask
in some religions
they don't believe
God is so powerful
he has created
innumerable universes
the Vedas describe
this is not the only
universe we are part of
there are innumerable
universes
so a person who has
created innumerable
galaxies
universes
that person will come
in a small speck
dust like particle
of a planet
he will come to such
a small
floating ball
when he is a master
of such a huge creation
so God should not come
he should not bother
to come
so some religion
although they believe
in God
personality of God
but they do not believe
that God will incarnate
to come here
so they tell
he can send his messenger
why God personally
has to come here
so that is why Krishna
tells here
his prime reason of coming
yes when I come here
I establish
the religious principles
also however
to establish
religious principles
I need not personally
come I can send
my messengers also
but the prime reason
why Krishna
comes is
so this question
was asked by
Akbar to Birbal
because
Akbar
professed
he was belonging
to Islamic faith
although he was
very open and he
was a devotee
Jeeva Goswami tells
and Akbar
was very favorable
for Vaishnavism
and Akbar
sponsored the
first
temples of
Vrindavan
he built a
library for
Jeeva Goswami
one of the six
Goswamis
and he banned
all kind of killing
in Vrindavan
so the
Goswamis told
Akbar is a
devotee
in his rule
but because
he had connection
with the
Islamic faith
he asked Birbal
that why
God should come
here God is
so great
just like I am
the king
I will not go
here and there
in some
small place
so Birbal told
my Lord
I will tell you
one thing
I will tell you
one day
don't worry
and one day
Akbar and Birbal
were taking
a stroll
across the
near the
some ladies
were sitting
and they were
taking care of
the prince
and suddenly
something happened
some commotion
happened
and the
prince fell down
from their lap
into the
water
and as soon as
Akbar saw that
he immediately
jumped in the
water
to save the
prince because
he is
prince his son
and Akbar
went there
in great haste
hurry and
then finally
the shot was
arranged by
Birbal
so Birbal told
my Lord
you personally
jumped into
water what was
the need for
you to jump
you could have
sent anybody
anybody could have
sent to
rescue
there are so
many best
swimmers
available
why you
personally
jumped
so Akbar
realized yes
because it was
my son
in danger
so that is
why Krishna
those part and
parcels the son
who are very very
eager to see
God who have
understood they are
not the body
and they are
very eager to
see God and
serve God
so just to
fulfill their
desires
to deliver the
pious people
who want to
go back to
God to
deliver those
people to
give a
chance to
them to
engage in the
loving service
of God
God comes
here
I purchase
something I
enter
supermarket
some
grocery store
and when I
go there
I purchase
some other
things also
although that
was not the
prime
motto of
going there
similarly the
prime motive
why God
comes here
God need
not come
here
understood for
some
management
purpose
but God
is so
God comes
here
Sadhu means
a person
is always
engaged in
service of
Krishna
does God
reincarnates
and then
when he comes
here there
are some
people who
are creating
disturbance for
the devotees
he kills
those people
also although
he can
create any
pandemic
he can
create some
natural
disaster
he can
kill
side by side
he kills
the demons
also
as well as
to re-establish
the principles
of religion
I admit
and then
he re-establishes
the principles
also
now anyway
he has
come
so he
speaks the
knowledge
also
I admit
myself
millennium
after
millennium
every
Yuga he
comes
in
Dwapar Yuga
he came in
his original
form
in Kalyuga
he came in
the form
of Chaitanya
Mahaprabhu
so when
God is
going to
come
all his
schedule
a great
personality
follows from
schedule
when he
is going
to come
so although
he can
break all
the schedule
but
nevertheless
he
gives
his
audience
to him
so this
is the
prime
motto
for which
God
descends
here
so these
things
may appear
to be
very very
confusing
that is why
this very
important
shloka
is there
now
Janma
karma
chame
divya
so one of
the devotees
he spoke
to me this
morning
and he told
Prabhu the
story which
you spoke
earlier
it is not
logical
so he was
talking about
one instance
when I told
Prabhupada
's
story in
one of
the lectures
that one
German
fellow
he came
to India
and he
told
simply by
they are
engaged in
some kind
of
activity
but here
I see
Lord Krishna
is simply
having
flute in
his hand
and he
is
standing
in
a
dancing
posture
so this
is
God
God
means because
he
is supremely
powerful
he need
not be
to give
illogical
few little
logical things
you speak
and yes
it may appear
to be
illogical
and when
I was
reading
Prabhupada
books
and many
devotees
when they
read
so many
examples
we are
not able
to
understand
or we
think
example
is less
logical
and
Bhagavatam
there is
a specific
verse
it is
mentioned
those
people
who are
not
very
advanced
they
will
think
the
bona
fide
Acharyas
are giving
some
twisted
meaning
to the
shlokas
however
this is
not
translation
if you read
you may
not
understand
the intent
or the
purport
of that
shloka
that is
why
Srila Prabhupada
explains
the
purport
behind
every
shloka
just like
if you
go to
a
restaurant
and somebody
tells
the
waiters
comes
the
purport
does not
make any
sense
if a
person who
knows
the intent
of
the
person
what he
is
asking
he will
translate
please
bring
me
cold
drink
so
literal
translation
is not
important
but
the intent
so thus
we have to be
very
advanced
in order to
understand the
logic which
may appear
to be
illogical in
the beginning
so what is
the logic
behind this
he told
because
Krishna kills
also
various
demons
so that
devotee
did not
see
Krishna
kills
Kali
also
Krishna has
taken
Vasudev
is killing
Vrindavanam
parityajya
padam ekam
na gacchanti
Krishna
never
takes one step
out of
Vrindavan
so what is
that Krishna
went to
Mathura
we all know that
Krishna left
Vrindavan
and Akrura came
Krishna Balram
were taken to
Vrindavan
and then he
fought with
Chanur
Mushtikasura
and many demons
he killed
Vrindavan
Shastras are
telling Vrindavanam
parityajya
padam ekam na
Krishna never
leaves Vrindavan
but history
tells
so Shastras
are wrong
so that is
why we
discuss in
the previous
class
this research
work
this independent
dependence
upon the
senses
what I
am seeing
is right
what I
am able
to understand
that is
what Krishna
tells
and many things
could be
bewildering
Krishna is
telling
I don't
take birth
I am eternal
but this
is wrong
thing Krishna
was
boasting
himself
we saw that
one
hunter
shot an
arrow
on the
toe of
Krishna
and Krishna
died by that
so how
do we
understand
one who
knows the
transcendental
nature of my
appearance
and activities
does not
upon leaving
the body
take his
birth again
in this
material
world
but attains my
eternal
abode
oh Arjuna
so that is
why Krishna
is telling
my janma
my birth
although I
am unborn
but the
process
which appears
transcendental
transcend means to
cross
they cross the
limit of all
the material
laws
so all of us
follow the
laws of
nature
doctor can
predict
that this is
how the
baby is
going to
develop the
embryo
comes out
and how
the
development
happens
but
Krishna's
birth is
not like
that
my personality
is natural
because Krishna
is telling
if somebody
understands
scientifically
the nature
of my
appearance
and activities
upon leaving
this body
he does
not take
birth again
in this
material
world
so if a
person understands
this
science
so people
think of
if I
understand
biology
I can
think
of
some other
means of
technology
I will slow
down
time
and I
will
become
immortal
in this
way
various
sciences
people
are
studying
to
gain
immortality
however
Lord Krishna
tells
you
simply
need to
understand
that upon
leaving this body
we do not
take birth
again in this
material
world
so that is
why
human life
is meant
only to
understand
Krishna
and all
the knowledge
which is
there all
the engineering
all the
sciences
are mentioned
in Vedas
also
people were
making
weapons and
bombs and
palaces
but using
the Vedas
so what is
the purpose of
all this
knowledge
so that is
mentioned in
the Bhagavad
Gita
Vedas to
serve
from all
the Vedas
I am to
be known
so Krishna
is telling
if somebody
can understand
me my
nature
then that is
the success
of all
education
system then such
a person
becomes
he
is fighting
with the
demons
why Supreme Lord
has to
fight
no whenever
any demon
comes
Krishna does
not fight
with the
demon Krishna
expands himself
into a
form which
is called
Vasudev
the four
handed
form Vishnu
form of
Krishna
it may appear
in two
hands also
but Vasudev
form that
is
visible in
Vrindavan
and became
visible in
a different
form which
is going
towards
Mathura that
is different
Vasudev
form so this
is the
science which
is mentioned in
the Vedas
about Krishna
so Krishna
is a
liar Krishna
told I
will not
go and then
Krishna left
Vrindavan
Krishna told
I will
come back
to
this
the
denizens
of higher
planets which
can
live in
invisible
form the
ghosts
live in
invisible
form so why
not
God can
live in
such an
invisible
form so
God
Krishna
always
stayed in
invisible
form in
Vrindavan
so that
these
work is to enjoy with his friends with his devotees in Vrindavan having a very
very peaceful life and how does Krishna take birth Krishna took birth how do we
understand his eternal no so this is also explained how Krishna took birth
there is no biological process that happens the way couple conceived the
child this process did not happen among the parents of Krishna so Krishna was
present in the heart of Vasudev from heart of Vasudev mind of Vasudev he went
to the mind of Devaki then he entered the womb of Devaki and immediately came
out in the four-handed transcendental form and then that four-handed form
Devaki requested Krishna please in order to bewilder the atheists you please take
two-handed form so as we discussed in the previous session Krishna is very
merciful somebody wants to become atheist Krishna will facilitate him give
him the logic to remain atheist and if somebody wants to become a devotee then
Krishna will give him knowledge how to become a devotee so some people don't
want if anybody sees a person has appeared with four hands he has to
surrender but then some people do not want to submit to God they want to
become God that is a desire to become bigger than the biggest in this world so
thus in order to help those people Krishna took form of a small boy and
similar fashion when Krishna was about to leave this planet hid it did a drama
many many people do drama isn't it here and when we watch movies we start crying
why because the acting is so real they act as if they are getting a heart
attack they are actually losing there is some loss in their life and when people
are watching movie they start crying seeing their acting so in the vectors
can act in such a perfect way that they are dying and something is happening why
Krishna cannot do that so that does Krishna fiends death but Krishna does
not die so when that hunter became very much worried why have shot an arrow to
a human being I thought it is some animal so he and then he realized he is
Krishna he's God himself you can very much worried so then Krishna told do not
worry this was my promise given to you in previous birth nobody can kill me I'm
eternal so you are my devotee it was just a pastime so in order to bewilder
atheists Krishna left a body also a snake can leave a skin behind Krishna can
leave entire body behind see my body is also there just like Vasudeva one form
is expanded it is going towards Mathura Krishna became invisible similarly
Krishna left one so-called body Virat Rupa and Krishna became invisible in
this material world so thus Krishna and his devotees we don't call their birth
and death we call appearance and disappearance this is the science of
Krishna so some of you are new and it may be difficult for you to understand
and it will be difficult because if you understand these things nicely then we
will not take birth again in this world so what is the proof Prabhu it is very
nice to hear all these things but how do we put faith in all these things so
Krishna gives here the proof in the next verse very important
so this is one of the strongest proofs of Krishna's transcendental nature of
being freed from attachment fear and anger being fully absorbed in me and
taking refuge in me many many persons in the past became purified by a knowledge
of me and thus they all attain transcendental love for me so people tell
you are psyching up yourself it is a brainwash a kind of specific training
to the brain you think that Krishna is God and I have come in contact with God
and thus you start hallucinating I am getting help in life everything is
happening good in my life my anger is going down my lust is going down I am
very happy I am very very satisfied simply it is hallucination that this
Krishna is God and this is happening to me it is your brain which is playing
games with you so this is the proof
many many people in the past have attained this position developed love for
Krishna we all love some living entity here we all love our parents we all love
our children we love our cousins our neighbors our friends animals we have
tremendous love for many or at least few living entities here but that love has
that love brought us freedom from attachment freedom from fear freedom
from anger freedom from has that love brought us that those things no I am
attached to many many things I am attached to those people I am attached to
satisfying my senses also I love my family members but I love to drink also
I love intoxication also I am addicted to watching some videos also I am
addicted to I am addicted to eating also I am addicted to so many other things
also so this attachment I am not free from the material attachments fear I am
not free from the fear I am scared of so many things I am scared of death I am
not free of anger but anybody who develops love for Krishna he gets
freedom from all attachments he's so much satisfied nothing else can disturb
the attention of a person that person becomes completely fearless that is why
the Saints would live in the jungle alone in the middle of night dead of
night just imagine any animal could be there Haridas Thakur he was sleeping
with the python in the same cave can you sleep with a snake next to you it is not
a pet snake wild snake python it can swallow you in the dead of night but
Haridas Thakur was sleeping chanting very nicely with a python in the same
cave some other devotee Vakreshwara Pandit I think no Murari Chaitanya Das
he was giving slap to the tigers in the jungle he was so much absorbed in ecstasy
of chanting Hare Krishna three days he would live within the water he appeared
500 years ago around Lord Chaitanya's time and three days he would be within
the water absorbed in thoughts of Krishna and nothing will happen to him
he will survive come out of water after three days and being absorbed in thought
of Krishna real personalities I am telling he would again start dancing and
in dancing and dancing in the jungle some tiger would come nearby he would
give a slap to the tiger and tiger also would not do anything under the
influence of Krishna is sitting in the heart of tiger also the tiger also was
subjugated by his devotion so like this many many extraordinary even devotees
are completely free from fear completely free from all attachment very very
peaceful free from all anger so all these things are possible when a person
develops love for Krishna it is not possible how much ever you love any
living entity you cannot reduce your attachment to the material objects means
you are not satisfied in love of that person you want this thing also that
thing was even that person you cannot love for a long time very soon you
realize the person has changed or not very good or some kind of fight will
happen even in the closest relationships so thus we can understand Krishna's
nature is very very different Krishna is completely spiritual and transcendental
had Krishna been a material mortal ordinary person then all of us are
loving ordinary mortals nothing helps nothing happens by loving and
understanding about ordinary people people have written great biographies
deeply analyze the life of many many leaders but one who understands the
science of Krishna who has gone of Krishna and Madhavam Agatha who attain
love of Krishna this unique thing happens to him all the material desires
has completely vanquished fear is vanquished and anger is vanquished and
extraordinary things Chaitanya Mahaprabhu fell down the stone melted by his touch
and that molten stone is still there in the temple when we take you for trip you
can see that in Odisha close to Jagannath Puri it is there many great
devotees Lord Chaitanya, Rasikananda Prabhu, Meera Bhai they entered the deities entered
the temple and never came out where are their bodies their bodies were never
found so these extraordinary events happen when a person is in love with
Krishna so many things we cannot see directly but we can see by the effect so
thus we can very clearly see that Krishna's body Krishna's existence is of
totally different nature because when a person develops love for Krishna all
the symptoms they write this is a proof of Krishna consciousness very solid
proof so thus we are so fortunate we understand we have got a glimpse of the
transcendental nature of Krishna so it is my humble request to you please try
to understand this one subject matter we are very fond of doing research
understanding science understand science but spend less time understanding the
creation understand the creator understanding the creator developing
love for him will make our life successful in this life will be free
from attachment fear and anger and pose this life there's no more birth person
attains his eternal position so this is the code of immortality understanding
the science of birth and activities of Krishna and developing love for Krishna
with this we will end today's session and some people are new today so some
announcements are there we have got very nice thing for all of you so as I told
our spiritual advancement as Krishna mentions here will depend upon how nicely
we take shelter of spiritual master so all of us should try to hear the voice
of Srila Prabhupada so to facilitate Srila Prabhupada's voice we have got all his
audios all the lectures of Prabhupada have been very nicely uploaded on the
SoundCloud those could be lectures on Bhagavad Gita on many many shlokas of
Bhagavad Gita what I'm discussing
