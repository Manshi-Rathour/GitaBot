Ashwata sarva vriksha naam devarshi naam chanaradaha
Gandharva naam chitra ratha haa siddha naam kapilo muni hi
Of all the trees I am the holy fig tree and among sages and demigods I am Narada
Of the singers of the gods Gandharvas I am chitra ratha
And among perfected beings I am the sage kapila
So the holy fig tree which we call the banyan tree, ashwatha tree is worshipable
This is also mentioned in nectar of devotion as one of the elements of devotional service
Similarly devarshi naam chanaradaha among all the demigods and sages
Sages amongst the demigods, Narada muni is the topmost
He is shaktyavesh incarnation of krishna, incarnation of the bhakti shakti of krishna
Narada muni is very special in the sense even though he appeared within this universe
But he is so free he can travel anywhere and everywhere
He can cross the boundaries of this universe and go to Vaikuntha and again come back to this material world
So such position is very very rare to be found
Then there is another species which is called Gandharva
Gandharvas are the celestial singers of demigods
So among the Gandharvas the best Gandharva chitra ratha that is also a representation, manifestation of krishna
Siddha naam kapilo muni, people want to perfect their lives by following the process of ashtanga yoga
So kapil muni is incarnation of krishna who came here to explain this process
In its true sense some people simply get carried away by the mystic powers which the process offers
You develop ashtasiddhis, you can make yourself very small, very huge, very light
You can control mind of others, kamavasaita or so many powers are praptisiddhi
You can extend your hand and get anything from any planet immediately
Or you can take any form whichever you desire
So all these wonderful things are given when a person follows this process
But ultimately devotees should not get carried away by these offerings
And the devotees, of course not now in the Kalyuga, this process is not possible in satyuga
When the mind and body was suitable it takes a very long time as we have discussed previously
So kapil muni explained this is to attain love of krishna
To focus your mind on lord krishna manifest within the heart
So that is why among all the siddhas perfect beings he is kapil muni
Of horses know me to be ucyaishrava
Who rose out of the ocean born of the elixir of immortality
Of lordly elephants I am Airavata
And among men I am the monarch
So when there was churning of milk ocean happening by the demigods and demons
And they wanted to have nectar
To have a long life and a healthy life
And when the churning was happening
Various ingredients and various creatures were manifest from that churning
And two such very unique creatures are this horse by the name ucyaishrava
Which was taken by the demons
And there came Airavata, the elephant
A very unique white elephant which was accepted by Indra
So both of these animals they came out by churning of the milk ocean
So they are representations of krishna
And among the men there are so many people
But the best among the men is the monarch, the king
So when people see the king
So this Bhagavad Gita is there for all the people of this universe
All the great sages of various times
Satyoga, Dwaparyoga, Treta Yoga, Kalyoga
So even though we are not aware of the Gandharvas
Although earlier people were having their audience
And there is a description in Mahabharat
How there was war between the various people of
They belong to different planets altogether
Dhruva Maharaj is fighting with the Yakshas
And 5000 years ago Dhruva Maharaj was lakhs of years ago
The Arjuna, Pandavas, they also fought with the Gandharvas
So they were very much aware
And even till Parikshit Maharaj's time when Pandavas went away
Parikshit Maharaj was doing the Yajna
So all the devatas came here and although devatas are not visible generally
But by the influence of Maharaj Parikshit by their mercy
They made themselves visible to common people
And they could see devatas moving around
But even though we do not have such perception now
Still we can appreciate oh kings are there
Now even kings are not there
Because kings did not use their position properly
So if you do not use our position properly
It will be taken away by the nature
So now we have got this human form of life
If we use this human form simply for sense enjoyment
Then we will be degraded to animal life
This position will be taken away from us
Freedom, power, enjoyment comes with responsibility
Higher responsibility
So in human life we have higher responsibility
Of liberating ourselves and other species also
So if we do not take it to proper use
Then we will be bereft of this body
Just like now there are no monarchs practically
It has been abolished by nature because they became degraded
But still if the king is there
Then the king is most powerful, most attractive
And when you see the king you should understand
He has got my potency
By that he is able to rule among men
So when you see king you should be able to think of Krishna
When you see Aravath, if at all you see Uchayashrava
You should be thinking of Krishna
These are Krishna's manifestations
Of weapons I am the thunderbolt
Among cows I am the surabhi
Givers of abundant milk
Of procreators I am Kandarpa
The god of love
And of serpents I am Vasuki
The chief
So among all the weapons
Wielded by various personalities
Thunderbolt is most powerful
Which is called Vajra
Which is held by Vajra
Which is held by Vajra
The thunderbolt is most powerful
Which is called Vajra
Which is held by Indra
This was made by the ribcage of Dadhichi Muni
So Dadhichi Muni was very exalted sage
A pure devotee of Krishna
And his body has become very very strong
By virtue of his devotional service
So when Ritrasura, great demon
He was very very difficult to overcome
The demigods threw their weapons
And he swallowed all their weapons
Like we take food
And now the demigods
Were bereft of all their weapons
Their powers
So they went to Lord Vishnu
Please help us, what do we do?
Please you incarnate us
We are not able to kill this demon
So then Lord Vishnu suggested them
Do not worry
There is no need of my incarnating
You go to Dadhichi Muni
With his body
And by using his bones
Vishwakarma
The heavenly architect
He will make a weapon for you
Vajra
By that weapon
That will be invested with my potency
And with that weapon
You will be able to kill Vritrasura
And they went to Dadhichi Muni
And Dadhichi Muni gave it very easily
So we can just understand
What is the level of a pure devotee
If somebody comes and asks
Please give me your body for my benefit
And this Dadhichi Muni
Indira told
And just see
This is the behavior of pure devotee
So Dadhichi Muni
Is the spiritual master
Of Ashwini Kumaras
Ashwini Kumaras are
The two demigods
Who are physicians
For heavenly planets
So they wanted to understand Bhagavatam
Now Indira got to know
That they are willing to understand Bhagavatam
And Indira also knows
That anybody who hears Bhagavatam
He becomes renounced
So he was thinking
If they become renounced by hearing Bhagavatam
And of course
A person who is devotee of Krishna
He may continue or he may leave his duties
And he may become preacher
Dedicated to spreading Krishna consciousness
So if at all they choose to follow this path
They dedicate themselves completely
Then who will be treating us?
We have these two physicians only
So then he told no no please don't hear Bhagavatam
Just like sometimes
The parents of the devotees
When they see my child is going to Hare Krishna
He is chanting
They will read Bhagavad Gita
But they will not wish their children should read Bhagavad Gita
Because they understand I am getting renunciation
If my children get renunciation
They will leave us
So they get very scared
And they don't want
My children to read them
But when they grow up I will let them to
You know slowly
So in this way
He was knowing the potency of Shrimad Bhagavatam
So he told Dadhichi Muni
Please I will sever your head from your body
If you teach them Bhagavatam
Do not do that
So then they came Ashwini Kumaras
And they told so he explained Dadhichi Muni
See I will be killed
He will remove my head Indira has told now what do I do?
So then they planned a strategy
They put horse's head
And they preserved his head
So all these things are possible
The head also can be removed and preserved
And the head of another animal
Lord Ganesha is not the only example of head transplant
It happened with Dadhichi Muni
Denizen of this planet
Of course you may not believe it
But if you read Vedas very nicely carefully
We will be able to understand these things
So this was the situation
Relationship between Dadhichi Muni
And Indira
Now Indira again
He is coming please give me your body
So this person has come
And he has told I will kill you
And then this person comes
And tells you please give me your body
For my safety
So which sane person would be doing that
But Dadhichi Muni did that
So this is the forgiving nature
Of a pure devotee
He is always the well wisher of the other person
Even though other person could be your killer
And Dadhichi Muni
In great joy
He gave up this body
And then Vajra was made
So among the weapons I am Vajra
Krishna is mentioning
Among the cows I am Surabhi
Givers of abundant milk
Surabhi can give whatever you want
Abundant milk, milk sweets, any other edible
Or it can produce even an army
Or whatever you may desire
Of pro creators I am Kandarpa
The god of love
And of serpents I am Vasuki
So whenever Krishna incarnates
He somehow engages
Many times Vasuki in the seva
Just like Matsya avatar happened
So the boat has to be pulled
All the species were put on the boat
In bible also we have such description
That the species were put on a boat
And they were saved from the devastation
Because history is history
It may be explained in a limited way
In some limited language
Which is belonging to certain region
In fact during devastation
The species were preserved on a huge boat
And all these species
They were carefully
Escorted by this
Matsya avatar of Krishna
And Vasuki was the serpent
Which acted as rope
Similarly
There is another great serpent
Incarnation
Ananta Shasmi Naga Naam
Which are many hooded, there are many serpents
More than one hooded
So Lord Krishna is telling
Ananta Shasmi Naga Naam Varuno
Yad Samaham
Pitranam Aryamachasmi
Yama Sanyamataamaham
Of the celestial Naga snakes
I am Ananta
And of the aquatic deities
I am Varuna
Of departed ancestors I am Aryama
And among the dispensers of law
I am Yama
Lord of death
Which is also incarnation of Krishna
Of aquatic deities I am Varuna
Of departed ancestors
Pitras I am Aryama
And among the dispensers of law
I am Yama, the lord of death
Prahaladash Chasmi Daitya Naam
Kaala Kalayatamaham
Mriganam Chamragedroham
Vayanateyashchapakshinam
Among the Daitya demons
I am the devoted Prahalad
Among the deities I am time
Among the beasts I am the lion
And among birds I am Garuna
The feathered carrier of Vishnu
Of purifiers I am the wind
Of the wielders of weapons
I am Ram
Of fishes I am the shark
And of flowing rivers I am the Ganges
Of all the creations
I am the beginning and the end
And also the middle
So of all the sciences Krishna is explaining
I am the spiritual science of the self
So there are various sciences
And the most important science is
The science of substance which
Animates this body
If only this body is active
There is use of studying or implementing
Other sciences
That is why the most important subject
Matter of study Krishna tells
Is Adhyatma Vidya, spiritual science
Of letters I am letter A
And among compounds I am
The dual word
And also in exhaustible time
And of creators I am Brahma
Whose many fold faces
Turn everywhere
So there are various Brahma's
Every universe has got a Brahma
Who is the most pious living entity
And our Brahma has got
Just four heads being
Very small universe
And there are other universes where Brahma's have
Eight heads, twenty heads, hundred heads
And many many more heads
And millions of heads also
It depends how big a universe he has to manage
This is how the Vedas describe
Various kinds of Brahma's
I am all devouring death
And I am the generator
Of all things yet to be
Among women I am fame
Fortune, speech
Memory, intelligence
Faithfulness and patience
So these are good qualities
Which are feminine in nature
And as soon as we see any good
Quality
Then we immediately
Trace the source of this quality
If somebody is very
Nice speaker we think oh who is
The trainer who has trained this person so nicely
When Srila Prabhupada's
Disciple would come to India
And these are western disciples
And they came to Odupi Math
Odupi Math is the center of the Madhva
Sampradaya
And when these devotees they were defeating
Impersonalists like anything very easily
So they became very very pleased
And they told this is a bona fide Sampradaya
And they gave a certificate
This is very wonderful how these
Westerners have become so expert in all
These Vedic conclusions they are defeating
All the Impersonalists
So as soon as we see any quality
We try to understand what is the trace
From where this quality is coming
So if we see such qualities
Fame, fortune, speech, memory, intelligence
Faithfulness, patience
So we should understand that these are also
Manifestations of Krishna
So if Krishna does not create such qualities
In mind and body nobody can manifest it
So there are various poetries
And it is increasing in number
So earlier only self realized souls
Were supposed to write poetries
But now everybody has got access
And they are all writing and people are listening also
So any composition should not be heard
Unless it is from a self realized soul
So but still
Among all such poetries
There is one unique poetry which is called
The Gayatri Mantra, Gayatri verse
Why this is unique?
Because the purpose of everything in this creation
Is to ultimately liberate a person from the
Cycle of birth, death, old age, disease
And all the anxieties
And Gayatri Mantra is meant only
For this purpose
Other mantras mentioned in the Vedas
Can fulfill your various material demands
But Gayatri Mantra
Is meant for liberation
So Krishna is telling of the poetry
I am the Gayatri verse
So Gayatri Mantra again it cannot be
Chanted by anybody
We need qualification to do it
Either a person should be devata
Resident of higher planet who is very very sattvic
Or the sattvic brahmana
Or the brahmanas belonging to this planet
So those people are supposed to chant
Gayatri thrice in a day
In three Sandhyas
Sandhyas means the junction time
So in the morning
In the noon time and in the evening time
They chant Gayatri so that
Unknowingly we commit many sins in the day
A person gets freedom from such sinful activities
I am also the gambling of cheats
And of the splendid
I am the splendor
I am victory, I am adventure
And I am the strength of the strong
Of the descendants of Vrishni
I am Vasudev
And of the Pandavas
I am Arjuna
Of the sages I am Vyas
And among great thinkers
I am Ushana
So Vrishni dynasty
All the kings who have come in the Vrishnis
Lord Vasudev, Krishna
And Balram
Can be called Vasudev
Because they are sons of Vasudev
So they both are
Glorious among all the kings
So they are Krishna himself
Direct manifestations of Krishna
His own form and his immediately
First expansion Lord Baldev
Both can be addressed as Vasudev
Although Lord Krishna usually is addressed as Vasudev
And of the Pandavas
I am Arjuna
We all know how Arjuna is so glorious
Among the Pandavas
And of the sages
I am Vyas
So Vyas, Ved Vyas is also incarnation of Krishna
The original spiritual master
So if at all there is any confusion
In the Veda
We should go and take shelter of Ved Vyas
And try to understand
From his Guru Parampara
Ved Vyas has explained to his disciple
He has explained to his disciple
In this way perfect knowledge of the Vedas is coming down
So of the sages
I am Vyas
So Ved Vyas has concluded
When he was dissatisfied by composing all the scriptures
Then he composed Shrimad Bhagavatam
When he was chastised by his spiritual master
Narad Muni
So Ved Vyas has concluded
In the conclusion of all the Vedas
Ate chansh kala punsam
Krishna stu bhagavan swayam
Lord Krishna is God, rest everybody
Is his expansion part and parcel
And among the great thinkers
I am Ushna
Ushna is Shukracharya
Shukracharya was very great thinkers
The greatest thinkers of all time
So he is also manifestation of Krishna
Among punishments
I am the rod of chastisement
And of those who seek victory
Of morality, of the secret things
I am silence and of the wise
I am wisdom
Furthermore, oh Arjuna
I am the generating seed of all existences
There is no being moving or unmoving
That can exist without me
So seed is such a wonderful creation
And there are various seeds
If you see
Mango tree
How wonderful it is
How tasty it is
And this entire
The fruit is
And this
All these wonderful fruits
The wonderful tree
It is coming here
The wonderful tree
It is coming just from a seed
The seed has got all the information
Even more wonderful is the fig tree
Fig seed is very very small
And in that small seed
Krishna has done wonderful coding
What should be the color of leaves
What should be the pattern of the tree
What should be the color of the fruits
And all these things are very nicely designed
And one small seed
Is able to manifest such a huge tree
So who has created
All these various seeds
So Krishna is telling
I am the seed
All these seeds are created by me
They are my manifestations
So Krishna has concluded
In the previous verse telling
There is no being moving or unmoving
That can exist without me
So Krishna has concluded
These are various manifestations
But please understand
Everything is my manifestation only
It is my expansion
Nothing can exist
Whether it is moving or not moving
Without me
So that is why anything you see
You should immediately think of Krishna
That this thing is coming from Krishna
O mighty conqueror of enemies
What I have spoken to you
Is but a mere indication
Of my infinite opulences
Know that all beautiful
Glorious and mighty creations
Spring from but a spark
Of my splendor
But what need is there Arjuna
For all this detailed knowledge
With a single fragment of myself
I pervade and support
This entire universe
So this has got two meanings
So first of all Krishna told
Arjuna what is need for all this
Detailed knowledge
So there is no limit to knowledge
Just like if somebody asks
That please let me know how this car functions
How the fuel is transformed into energy
How the piston moves
How the wheels rotate
How the AC works
And so many other things are there
So somebody will tell
What is the need of all this knowledge
You use this knowledge
For what this entire thing is there
It is existing
So that is why Krishna is telling to Arjuna
You are already a pure devotee
What is the need for all this detailed knowledge
Please understand with a single
Fragment of myself
What is the meaning of single fragment
So Krishna if his energies
Can be divided into four parts
So three parts
Maintain the spiritual world
Which is called Vaikuntha
Mainly the living entities live in a place
Where there is no birth and death
But some living entities who are envious of God
They are sent to the material world
So which is called one ansha
One portion of the four
Which is also called Ekpad Vibhuti
And another meaning is
Of Ekanshena is
Krishna has got so many ansha
So many expansions
And simply by one expansion
Expanding himself as Mahavishnu
Krishna has expanded
In so many
Completely powerful forms
Which are called Vishnu Tattvas
So if a brick is broken
It can divide
Itself into various fragments
But the brick loses its existence
But Krishna can divide himself
Into unlimited forms who are
As powerful as Krishna
This is God
There is no limit to glories
And powers of God
So if God is having 10x power
He can expand immediately
This expansion which is also having 10x power
Third expansion 10x power
And unlimited expansions who are having
The same powers
There is no limit to power of God
And like this all the planets
That we see here in this material universe
Like this various planets are there
In the spiritual world
And there are no living entities ruling
But Krishna rules all those planets
He is a predominating personality
So you can just imagine
That so many expansions
Of Krishna are there
And one such expansion called Mahavishnu
He comes here
And he is able to create
And maintain this entire
Material existence
Which is having
We are part of one universe
Unlimited universes are there
And one expansion Mahavishnu
Just imagine what is Krishna's power
Who is Krishna
Which person we are trying to understand
This is the purpose of all the Vedic knowledge
To understand who is Krishna
Krishna is not
Only a person who did some politics
And some loving past times
5000 years ago
Acted as a king and sometimes as a coward boy
He is this personality
By his one expansion
He is maintaining
Unlimited infinite
Material universes
Just imagine what is the power
And we want to understanding
Using our intelligence
That is not possible
With one single fragment of myself
I pervade and support
This entire universe
So this is the last verse of Krishna
Describing the opulence of Krishna
What can be better description
Than this verse
With a single fragment of myself
I pervade and support this entire universe
And this person is offering us an opportunity
To have a very intimate
Loving relationship with him
So any person who can support entire
Material cosmos
Unlimited universes
If we have a relationship with him
This is the difficulty in our life
This is the purpose of all the
Vedic knowledge that we have
So all these descriptions
Ultimately are meant
To bring a person
To the platform of
Attraction towards Krishna
But such attraction
Is not easy
So Krishna comes here
As Krishna to describe his opulences
He manifests himself as
Holy name simply by chanting
The holy name of Krishna
We can understand all his opulences
So Krishna comes in so many
Incarnations just to give us this
Understanding
Please understand who am I
And you will be satisfied when you
Develop your relationship with me
But it is not easy
To understand as long as
A person is trapped in the process of
Pravritti
So the Vedas describe
When we come here
Two ways of leading
One's life
Which are the two ways
One path is called the path of
Inclination
We all have certain inclination
That is called Pravritti
When we were small child
We were very much inclined to
Mud
Most of us
But now we have grown up
Now there is no inclination to enjoy mud
Likewise there were various
Inclinations
And now our inclinations could be different
A small child may not be inclined
For
Carnal sexual pleasures
But grown up bodies they are attracted
Towards those pleasures
So this is
A big catch
That we have to understand
It is not our desire
That we are chasing in life
We are trying to chase the desires
Of the body
The inclination which we have got as per
The plan of the nature
We have got
Certain mind and body
And that is under control of
Material nature
So as the nature changes our mind and body
We develop similar inclinations
Pig is inclined to live in drain
Eat stool
We are designed to live in some other place
Eat something else
Crows are attracted towards something else
Swans are attracted to something else
Every living entity in a similar fashion
Are following the inclinations
Of their body
But this is
A great cheating
Living entity thinks oh this is my
Inclination
I will be satisfied, no you will not be satisfied
By this thing
So this word is used throughout the Vedas very very nicely
So the Vedas tell
Ok you want the path of enjoyment
So you follow
But please follow the Vedas
If at all you want to satisfy
Even your inclinations
Do not try to follow
Path of sense enjoyment
Like that of animals
So human being
When he follows the Vedas
Then even though certain
Inclinations are there
He will be able to
Realize down the line
That these inclinations
Are not satisfying me
And eventually he will be taking
To nivritti marg
By following this pravritti marg
If he follows the Vedas very very nicely
He can approach up to heavenly planets
Dharm artha kaama moksha
This is called pravritti marg
First of all be very religious
If you follow the path of religion very nicely
Artha money will automatically follow
Economic development
And followed by money would be
Your sense enjoyment
We want money to afford resources
So that we can enjoy the resources
That is called kaama
And if you follow this process very nicely
You will understand this kaama
Fulfilling the lusty desires
Demands of my mind and body is not satisfying me
And then finally
He may be able to understand
One day this moksha is also not satisfying
Then he aims for
The ultimate aim of life
That is attaining love of god
But still if he follows pravritti marg
There is a possibility
That one day
He will be able to develop some sense
And then he understands
That oh this pravritti is very dangerous
He will read
He will develop further understanding
He will develop further understanding
Of the vedas
And then he reads in the vedas
How vedas describe
Patanga, matanga, kuranga, bhringa, meena
So people are being motivated
Yes you follow your passion
Whatever you want in life
You fulfill that
Then you will be happy
This is very great cheating
So scriptures describe just like deer is there
Kuranga
Kuranga deer is attracted
He is very fond of music
And he follows his passion very nicely
So the hunter knows the passion of the deer
And the deer comes out
And he gets stunned
When he hears the flute being played
By the hunter
And because he gets stunned he cannot move
And then he is captured and killed
Matanga elephant
Elephant is very fond of she-elephant
So such a big animal
It is very difficult to capture an elephant
But how they capture elephant
So a she-trained she-elephant
She rubs the elephant
It is told behind the ears
An elephant gets agitated
And then she runs along
A certain predefined path
And there is a big covered pit in that path
And the elephant chasing
She-elephant falls into that pit
And then loses its life
Similarly
Bhringa, bhringa means
It sits on the flower
It is very much attracted by the aroma of the flower
By the color of the flower
It sits on it
And in the evening time he is so much absorbed
In taking out nectar
It is sitting there and the flower closes in the evening
Then it is not able to come out
And loses its life
Similarly we have discussed
Moth
The moth also dashes into fire
That is called Patanga
So moth thinks
If I just see this fire
It is so attractive
Moth is the passion of moth
Lizing, chasing
This light
It is very fond of seeing light
And thus it gets attracted
By the light of fire
And then jumps into fire, loses its life
Similarly
Meena, Meena means fish
How the fish is caught
Using the bait used by the fishermen
And the fish thinks
If I get that thing I will be very satisfied
Fish is very fond of satisfying the tongue
And then it catches the bait
It is hooked out, fish loses its life
So we should understand
From this example
We are chasing our passion
But you see what is the result of this passion
Only because of this passion
These living entities lose their life
Because they were passionate
About fulfilling one of the senses
And human life
We are having five senses
And all the senses are very strong
So we can just imagine
If a person is not trained in controlling the senses
How horrible his life is
Your servant
Whatever you command, universe will fulfill
Yes, that is a fact
Krishna has created this material universe
Just to fulfill our demands
But our demands are never satisfied in this way
And in this body demands are not satisfied
Universe gives another body to us
But with every body comes
The misery of death
Disease, old age and birth
And in this way living entity keeps on suffering
Because of these desires
So thus people
Talk of various
Workshops of happiness
Of stress management
In IITs they have now departments of
Understanding the science of happiness
But they don't understand
All this stress is the stress
Of a deer, a fish
A bumble bee
An elephant or a moth
A moth is in stress
Oh, I could not chase the fire
And then the moth is crying
And the moth is in depression
So it is better that the moth did not chase the fire
So similarly why we are under so much of stress
Because we could not attain some sense object
What we desired
We could not fulfill our passion
But it is the passion of the living entity
Which is killing us
Giving us bodies life after life
And thus we suffer from so many diseases
As now we are in the grip of pandemic
Because we had some desire we got this body
Like this we keep on taking bodies
Human life is a bit comfortable
Animal bodies are horrible
Always afraid, scared and so many other calamities
They have to face
So in this way the purpose of human life
Is not actually pravritti
Nivritti is meant for foolish people
So such foolish people
Vedas tell them okay you want to fulfill your desires
Take this long path, millions of years
You take various bodies
But please keep on following the Vedas
In this way you will develop certain sense
And you will understand oh nivritti is the way
This passion is creating all problem in my life
So the real path
Real process is nivritti
What is nivritti?
Nivritti means understanding oh this is the cause of my trouble
So I am attracted towards fire
If at all I get to enjoy the fire
I will burn myself
If I do not get the fire
I will die in depression anyway
That I could not get fire
This is the life of a materialist
He is anyway killed
If he attains sense object
That sense object will create all disturbance and death
If he or she is not able to get sense object
There is depression and again stress
I could not get that
So we have to understand
These are not our desire
These are desires of the body
I don't want to eat mud
Child body produces such desire that you eat mud
It is simply because of
Identification with the body
I am like a ghost
In control of material nature
Nature is forcing me
You chase mud
You chase chocolate
You chase young man
You chase young woman
You chase corporate ladder
You chase a business
You chase sannyas
You chase even going to Himalayas and moksha
That is also cheating
Living entity cannot be satisfied
Either by jumping into fire
Or by escaping from that jump
We are
Living entities
We want enjoyment
That is why we have senses
But satisfying the senses as per the pravritti
Is very very dangerous
So the shastras mention bhagavad gita
In third chapter it is mentioned
There may be some enjoyment
That is a fact
That is why we all follow that path
But this very enjoyment
Is the ultimate living
Enemy of the living entity
So when you see
Your phone you get very much satisfied
You see one more
You get one more drop of dopamine
You get satisfied
So this pleasure we are getting
This very pleasure is the ultimate enemy
Of the living entity
So we have to be very very cautious
Be very very aware
That no this is not my desire
These are the desires of the body
So we should learn how to behave neutrally
Not get disturbed by the thing
Which is repellent to this mind and body
Do not get
Desired to chase the objects
Which are appealing to this mind and body
It is only illusion
It will produce more and more bodies
However
This neutrality cannot be attained
Artificially simply by discussing knowledge
For this we need
Higher pleasure
And how that
Higher pleasure is possible
So that higher pleasure is possible
When a person is able to meditate
Upon Krishna
That is why it is told
Those people who are
Of all Krishna
They are singing your glories
Or by singing your glories
They can get nivritti
From all the Trishnas
All the other desires
So by meditating upon Krishna
A person develops satisfaction
So much satisfaction
That he does not feel like jumping into fire
I am satisfied in my place only
However
To have this satisfaction
A person needs to have knowledge of Krishna
And attaining knowledge
Knowledge of Krishna's spiritual manifestations
Is difficult
That is why Lord Krishna
To help a person begin his spiritual life
He has explained all these things
Arjuna has kindly asked
How an ordinary person can meditate upon Krishna
So as soon as we see
Anything wonderful
We see any person who is very intelligent
We should immediately think of Krishna
We see anybody who is very good
Very humorous, we should understand
This humor is also created by Krishna
We should develop the sense of being humorous
If we see anybody very kind
Our family is very kind to us
We should see
Oh Krishna is taking care of me through my family
And this kindness is Krishna's manifestations
If Krishna makes my family members
Like snakes
I will be killed as soon as I am born
But I am nurtured, nourished very nicely
It is Krishna's mercy
So like this everywhere
Anything good we notice
We should immediately think of Krishna
I have done fasting, then I drink water
The next day, oh water is so tasty
This taste Krishna has created
When we are sick, we don't feel like anything
Eating anything, we will die
If Krishna does not create taste
So Krishna kindly has created taste
And Krishna has created a body in which we can relish the taste
So any good thing that we notice
We should immediately think of Krishna
However, we are advanced
So we should not restrict ourselves
To this process
We should follow the direct process
Krishna mentioned in the nutshell
Verses Chatushloki Bhagavad Gita
And which Krishna
Has mentioned at the end of the 9th chapter
Which Krishna will mention again at the end of the Bhagavad Gita
Man-mana bhaumad bhakto
Madhyaji maam namaskuru
Always think of me
Constantly thinking of
The spiritual form of Krishna directly
Rather than focusing on the material things
And directly doing this thing
Directly focus on the spiritual form of Krishna
Then automatically
In a stage we will be able to appreciate Krishna's presence
Everywhere
So this is the sum and substance
Of all the activities
Which a living entity is supposed to do
As per the Vedas, all the knowledge
Which he is supposed to follow in the Vedas
And that is
Smrtavyam smrtatam satatam vishnu
Vismrtavyana jatuchit
So never forget this thing
Our advancement in spiritual life should be measured by
How much I am able to absorb
Myself in thoughts of Krishna
This movement is
Just promoting
Consciousness of Krishna
Constant absorption in the thoughts of Krishna
Success of human life is to the degree
A person is able to absorb
Himself or herself in thoughts of Krishna
But how to have
Such thought of Krishna
This is a great confidential
Science
A great secret
Which even devotees do not understand at times
So let me share
A very nice instructive
Reply to a letter
Written to Prabhupada
By one of his very nice
Advanced
Disciples who was leading a temple
At that time
So let us read the letter
Verbatim so that we can get
The true essence of it
So the temple president of St. Louis
Misuri
Makhanlal Prabhu
Sent along
Four page missive
Recommending four new devotees for initiation
But mainly detailing
Two specific questions regarding
The development of his
Krishna consciousness
So this was the system if you want to take initiation
So the local temple
President, the leaders of that center
They will recommend to Prabhupada
These devotees are following very nicely
Please accept them as your disciples
So in this letter, four devotees are being recommended
Like this to Prabhupada
That please accept them as your disciples
So without sanction of the president
A person cannot take initiation from the guru
But mainly
Detailing two specific questions regarding
Development of his Krishna consciousness
He explained that for the last two years
He has been bathing and dressing the deities
Of Sri Sri Gaur Netai
Gaur Netai means Lord Chaitanya
And Lord Nithyananda
Incarnation of Krishna and Balram
In particular he has been trying
To focus on Lord Nithyananda
Why he is focusing on Nithyananda Prabhu
He cited several references
From Srila Prabhupada's books about the
Importance of Nithyananda Prabhu
And explained because I always
Need more spiritual strength
And the higher taste
Param drishtva nivartate
Love of God in pursuance of your
Instructions and other
Statements by the Vaishnava Acharyas
I have been trying to attain the mercy
Of Lord Nithyananda and attachment
To his lotus feet by your causeless
Grace
He indicated however
That this was drawing
Criticism from some of his God brothers
Although he feels that
It is Srila Prabhupada's desire
That he and all Prabhupada's
Disciples develop love for
Lord Nithyananda and eventually
Lord Chaitanya he now submitted
The matter to Srila Prabhupada
For confirmation or correction
So this is the way how Krishna should be
Approached
So directly Krishna
Should not be approached Krishna should be
Approached through devotees the greatest devotee
Of Krishna
Or Lord Chaitanya is Nithyananda Prabhu
So it is told
A person will be able to control
His passions control his senses
Nicely pull them away from the sense
Objects
Only when he is able to get
Mercy of Nithyananda Prabhu
And when Nithyananda Prabhu is
Merciful not that
We will be neutral
Towards sense enjoyment
But Tukha
We will realize oh this pleasure is Tukha
This is third class pleasure
So where is the struggle if you realize
That this if the moth realizes
This pleasure of seeing fire is third
Class then he saved
There is no struggle so this is
The platform which
A person can rise himself to
If he gets the mercy of Nithyananda Prabhu
And after receiving such mercy of
Nithyananda Prabhu he gets mercy of Chaitanya
Mahaprabhu and after getting mercy of
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu he is able to understand
Radha and Krishna so understanding
Radha and Krishna is not easy subject
Matter so he was asking
But some disciples are criticizing me
So he submitted for Prabhupada
Final dictum
That what is understanding
How it should be done
How can I approach Nithyananda Prabhu because
Without approaching Nithyananda Prabhu cannot approach
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu cannot make your
Spiritual life perfect
Since you stated in Shrimad Bhagavatam
That one should fix his mind
3rd Canto 25th chapter 44th verse
There is a purport
So in that purport Prabhupada has mentioned
One should fix his mind on Krishna
Or any incarnation
So he is asking
So some other disciples are criticizing
Why Nithyananda Prabhu Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is supreme
You worship him directly they would have suggested
So he is telling you have told
To do like this whether I am right or not
Is it the right process to fix the mind
On the lotus feet of Nithyananda Prabhu first
On the strength of the statement by Narottam Das Thakur
That even is actually serious about
Going back to home back to Godhead
One should take shelter of Lord Nithyananda
Sonadhar Acharya has recommended
One should first take shelter of Lord Nithyananda
We are trying to take shelter
At his lotus feet by your grace
Since this love for Lord Nithyananda
Frees one from all material desires
Is it necessary that every disciple
Eventually develop a desire
To love him in order to become
A pure devotee
A pure unalloyed devotee in this life
So this was one question
That should every disciple come to this platform
Of loving the lotus feet
Of Lord Nithyananda Prabhu
Or there is any other way also
Makhan Lal's another question was
Whether in course of doing devotional service
He should try to fix his mind
Specifically on Krishna's form
On Krishna's pastime and form
Or his temple deity
Sri Sri Gournithai
Or whether since devotional service
To the Lord is non different from him
It was enough to be simply absorbed
In the service itself
So very nice question
So when we tell think of Krishna
What is the meaning of this thinking of Krishna
Should I think of the pastimes of Krishna
Because it is told
A person has to meditate on
Qualities, form, pastimes etc
So should we
Think of the activities
Pastimes of Krishna and form
Or the form of the deities
Which we are worshipping in the temple
Is it also Krishna
Sri Sri Gournithai
The particular deity they are worshipping
Or whether since devotional service
To the Lord is non different
There is no difference between form of Krishna
Person of Krishna and Krishna's seva
So whether if I absorb myself
Simply in the seva
That is also sufficient
That is also thinking of Krishna
It is enough to be simply absorbed
In the service itself
Again he cited several quotes from
Is it sufficient for your disciples to meditate
Only on their prescribed duties
Or when you say
Are you actually requesting us
To constantly think about
The lotus feet of the Lord
And simultaneously render our service
So what is the meaning of
When you tell
In other places when you tell we should think of Krishna
So does it mean we should
Think of our seva only
Or we should try to think of
Lotus feet of Krishna while doing the seva
Are you actually requesting us to constantly
Think about the lotus feet of the Lord
And simultaneously render our service
He brought his letter to a close
With a humble prayer
This is how we should write the letters and ask questions
I am asking these questions
For my self purification
In order to expand my devotional service
By your grace
However I am begging that
You please don't let these questions upset
Your translating work
Which is the heart and soul of your disciples
I just want to understand these points
In your book so that
I can properly represent you
In this position you have given me
As temple president
So we may ask questions
Out of our curiosity
So such kind of questions
Should not be asked to spiritual masters
But only questions which are relevant
For spiritual advancement
So this is one thing
So he is telling I am asking these questions
For my devotional service
You have given me a responsibility
As the leader of the temple
So to fulfill that role I am asking this question
Another thing is
You know so many questions
We can ask for even
Satisfying our intellectual
Thirst
So that also should not be the purpose
The purpose should be self purification
So many things are intellectually
Not satisfying in the Vedas
Just like Krishna told to Arjuna
He is asking how are you present
Of this thing
So it is not necessary to understand
What is necessary to understand is
We have to develop our attraction towards Krishna
To this effect various descriptions
Of this world are given
Various sciences are explained
Not exactly that we try to understand
All those sciences but appreciate Krishna's
Power that he has created these wonderful
Sciences
So for my purification I should be doing
Any activity or asking the question
So he is telling for my purification
For doing the service
Devotional service I am asking this question
And some questions because
We are ignorant it may offend
The devotee
The spiritual master
So of course spiritual master does not take
Offenses but in ignorance if he tells
Something if he gets offended there is a disaster
For our life
So that is why he is begging
Pardon that please do not let these questions
Upset your translating work
Which is the heart and soul of your disciples
I hope it upset you my question
Srila Prabhupada was pleased to hear
From one of his
Early disciples and praised
Makan Lal for his sincerity
Before answering his questions
So I will take five more minutes
Please stay put with me it is very important
The conclusion of how to do
All this meditation on Krishna
Prabhupada is revealing here
Srila Prabhupada was pleased
To hear from one of his disciples and praised
Makan Lal for his sincerity
Before answering his questions
Prabhupada answers
My blessings are always with you
As you have requested
You are a very good devotee and
Servant of Krishna
So far your questions are concerned
Nithyananda is the
Principle of the Guru
So Nithyananda Prabhu is
The Guru principle
The Guru takes a person to Krishna
This is the purpose of Guru
So Nithyananda Prabhu is the original Guru
So Prabhupada replies
The Gurudev is the incarnation
Of Nithyananda
Anyone strictly following
In the instruction of the Guru
Is following Nithyananda
The price
Now Prabhupada is telling here
You want to be Krishna conscious
You want to think of lotus feet of Nithyananda
Or Chaitanya Mahaprabhu
The biggest price to pay
If he wants to become Krishna conscious
Is that
He must dedicate himself
To following the order of the
Spiritual Master
Mahat Seva
If the spiritual master is pleased with disciple
Then the blessings of Guru will be there
That is the best way
To become Krishna conscious
And Krishna is non different
From Nithyananda
If you pray to Lord Nithyananda
To help you become dedicated
In the service of your Guru
So you may pray to Lord Nithyananda
To help you become dedicated
In the service of your Guru
Krishna consciousness
Now Prabhupada writes
Krishna consciousness cannot be achieved
Artificially
You should approach Nithyananda Prabhu
Through your spiritual master
So this is very important point
So sometimes devotees
They think
Deity in my temple
Or in my house is all in all
If I worship the deity
If I think of my deity
Very nicely
And that will make me Krishna conscious
If I follow the rules and regulations
Follow all the regulative principles very nicely
No, that is the beginning
The actual stages
So Krishna consciousness
As his devotee when he is worshiping
Gournita he is telling
To focus on the lotus feet of Nithyananda Prabhu
That is very good
That is Prabhupada's instruction only
When we are worshiping the deities
We should specifically meditate on the lotus feet
And pray to Krishna
For forgiveness
So in this way by meditating on lotus feet
Deity worship should be performed
And specifically a person needs to
Approach through Nithyananda Prabhu
This is further advanced understanding
But Prabhupada is writing here
Krishna consciousness cannot be achieved
Artificially
So this is but artificial
Way of being Krishna conscious
That simply by thinking of lotus feet
Always I will be able to become Krishna conscious
No, so that is why some devotees
Think oh chanting is the way
So let me chant here entire day
Do 64 rounds every day or 100 rounds every day
Let me just chant keep on chanting
Or Krishna has
Explained himself in Bhagavad Gita
Bhagavad Gita will solve all the problems of life
So let me read Bhagavad Gita very nicely
So we have to understand no
Simply by
Chanting, taste for chanting
Cannot be developed ordinarily
Simply by reading
Taste for reading cannot be developed
The taste can be developed
This taste is very very difficult
Yes we can develop but it will take
Very very long time
So the quickest way
Of developing this taste is to
Prabhupada is telling
What is the best way to become Krishna conscious
What is the best way
That is the price
So I can purchase anything by giving money
But how can I purchase this consciousness
This Krishna consciousness
When a person is absorbed in the thoughts
Of Krishna constantly
This is the highest pleasure that a person
Can attain in life
And there is no birth, death, old age, disease
Person gets everything whatever he cannot
Even think of simply by this process
All the results which are
Attained by following Karma yoga,
Jnana yoga, Ashtanga yoga
All the results are attained automatically
By a person who is fixed in Krishna consciousness
So how can I purchase this
So the price is he must dedicate
Himself to following the order of
The spiritual master
So a person should know what is the order
Instruction of the spiritual master
And that order should be taken
As one's life and soul
In this way when a person is with all his heart
Always thinking
Meditating upon the order of the
Spiritual master
The instruction of the spiritual master
Should be the chief
Object of meditation for the disciple
So that is why many times in the scriptures
Lotus feet are synonymously
Compared to the instructions actually
So when a person is actually
Meditating upon the instructions
So this is very important instruction
For the disciple she asked
Prabhupada, are you present in your form also
Prabhupada told yes
But I am more present, spiritual master
Is more present in his instructions
So meditation upon the instruction
That is the real way
Of being Krishna conscious
And of course in order to follow
Those processes nicely
That process nicely of fulfilling the instructions
We have to keep ourselves pure, we have to worship deity
We have to read books
We have to think of lotus feet of Krishna
While doing our seva
We have to think of Krishna
But artificially it cannot be attained
Unless Krishna is pleased
So we should try to understand the desire of
Spiritual master and one must dedicate
Himself to following the order
Of the spiritual master
So rather than always
Trying to
Meditate
Sit in the temple and meditate on Krishna
Such absorption in Krishna
Is not attained
But Krishna
Srila Prabhupada is recommending
You may pray to Lord Nithyananda
To help you become dedicated
In the service of your Guru
So when I am dedicated
Completely for my
Spiritual master then automatically
Krishna, spiritual master
Nithyananda Prabhu, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu
Their lotus feet will become manifest
In our heart without any effort
So this is the way
So that is why Krishna consciousness
Is not an armchair theory
In 4th chapter verse 34
It is mentioned
This point devotees miss
We think by reading
By seeing Krishna
By worshiping directly or by chanting
And hearing I will develop taste
And we wonder why taste is not coming
So Prabhupada mentions
This taste is developed
Then the same form of Krishna
You see and Prabhupada tells
These pictures are windows to Vaikuntha
You will understand how
These pictures are actually windows to Vaikuntha
And we can understand access
The spiritual content of all these
Transcendental pictures
We can access the spiritual content
The spiritual bliss behind all the instructions
All the words in the book
Kirtan becomes relishable
Darshan becomes relishable
When a person has dedicated his meditating
And trying hard to fulfill
The instructions of the spiritual master
This is the price of becoming Krishna conscious
Thinking of Krishna always
So for those devotees who cannot do it
Krishna has described
These various opulences are there
You can meditate on Himalayas, on Meru, on Vasuki
And Monarch and XYZ
But we fortunately know the process
So we should try to take up this process
And thus become Krishna conscious
So this is the theory
Now you have to practically apply it
Try to apply in your life
And then you will automatically see how
We increase our Krishna consciousness
