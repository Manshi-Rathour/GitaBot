Once a person came to Chanakya Pandit and he told see I've got some very fantastic news
about this person.
So Chanakya told he was very eager to share hold on hold on.
So this news which you have got is that something good about the other person?
So he tells well no it's not good about that person.
Okay are you sure that it is true?
He told well I am not sure it may not be true.
Okay you are not sure.
Then Chanakya asked is this news beneficial for me?
So he told it may not be beneficial for you.
Then Chanakya told then there is no time to hear such news.
So this was his litmus test whether to hear something about third person or not.
So that is called gossip.
Gossip means people are very fond of criticizing others, speaking making some statements which
may not be true and which are not beneficial at all simply gossip and that gossip has taken
the form of media newspapers in which we are wasting one or two hours some people every
day and in those two hours you can chant 16 rounds you can read Bhagavad Gita you can
liberate yourself and make your life successful.
So it is difficult to find time to read the scriptures but for reading news and for other
things we are able to take out time because we are very very interested in gossip.
So Chanakya Pandit in this way he was able to filter very principled man very sharp moralist
if something is not good about other person if it is not beneficial for us and it may
not be true what is the point in hearing that.
Similarly when we are new in spiritual life we may get confused by some statements you
know many atheists they will make very logical statement very logical because Krishna tells
As a person surrenders so do I reciprocate.
In the way a devotee wishes to act in relationship with God, God reciprocates.
Bird has some desire Krishna sanctions give the intelligence to bird how to have that
desire how to fulfill that desire is it not amazing.
Krishna has created the object to fulfill the desires of all the species and Krishna
has given unique instincts also by which they can trace the objects of satisfaction or desire.
Bird wants to make nest how to find straws to make nest how to combine them together
bird has got knowledge how to produce offsprings how to take care of the eggs how to do hatching
how to go and sit rightly over them bird has got knowledge.
Pig wants to eat stool where to find stool how to pick has got knowledge if it's stool
it is septic it is very harmful for our body but for pigs body it is very healthy so the
body has been designed in a way so those species who desire eating stool and nasty things anything
you get the body of a pig and the pig's internal system is so nice you eat stool and you become
very fat and healthy by eating that so in this way God is fulfilling everyone's desires.
So beautifully it is mentioned in the scriptures.
The smaller than the smallest the infinite soul both are sitting in the heart.
Some people the soul lives here but no scriptures are not telling.
And then these two birds are there.
So this bird is sometimes eating sitting in the body sometimes eating the fruit of lamentation
sometimes that of jubilation but this bird is always dissatisfied hopping from this branch
to another branch and then one more bird which always keeps company with this bird.
So the fruit eating bird is ourselves the Jeevatma and the observing bird that is Paramatma
who is also there with this other bird.
So the other bird Paramatma is not at all interested in enjoying the pleasures of this
body the Paramatma is just watching when will this bird turn its face towards me then only
it will be satisfied till then it keeps on sanctioning fulfilling the desire facilitating
the desires of the other bird.
So in this way if a person wants to act in an unfavorable relationship with Lord he wishes
to become atheist then Krishna creates situation by which a person can believe God does not
exist or even when he incarnates he may think of him as some powerful man as a magician
but not God.
Just like many many leelas are there of Krishna when Krishna takes birth Krishna appeared
in 400 form immediately wish child takes birth in 400 form and that too with helmet
earrings and everything was there all is paraphernalia and then mother Yashoda she told oh God please
come in 200 form to bewilder the atheists and Krishna granted her request also because
she understands the purpose of Lord Krishna comes here to save his devotees and to bewilder
the atheists also because the atheist wishes to remain bewildered and when Krishna is leaving
his leaving this planet or disappearing from this planet then again he does another leela
he had killed so many people very very powerful people single-handedly even when he was very
small he killed Putana, Trinavarta many other big big powerful yogis, demoniac yogis.
But when Krishna is disappearing from this planet he dies he appears to have died like
an ordinary mortal some very powerless hunter shot an arrow simple arrow on the foot of
Krishna and Krishna left his body so it is again to bewilder the atheists.
Krishna has created all the bodies so many bodies it is not that Krishna has died he
has left one body which appears like Krishna.
So this moshal leela all these pastimes are mentioned in the Bhagavatam so there is wonderful
shloka also in which Purana I am forgetting as of now Padma Purana or some other Purana
so it mentions that why in scriptures apparent contradictions and these things are present
so that is also to bewilder the atheists.
So some people by reading scriptures also they would remain bewildered because the scriptures
are also written in such a manner at the same time scriptures are also written in a manner
that a person can approach absolute truth.
So if we read scriptures with the help of spiritual master as Krishna advised in Bhagavad
Gita previous chapter with humility with surrender you render service then a person will be able
to understand the Vedas and become Tatvadarshi and if you approach directly or some person
who has given his own interpretation then a person will end up only in bewilderment.
So the scriptures that is God's creation his incarnation will give clarity confidence
faith knowledge to the devotees and the same incarnation will bewilder the atheists also.
The same Vedas will enlighten a person the same Vedas will put a person into ignorance
also so this is how God's creation is so wonderful.
So some people some atheists are so strongly willing to deny the existence of Krishna
that Krishna gives them all the logic from the heart how to deny his existence
and if a person has just begun his spiritual life they can confuse him very very expertly
and he may lose his spiritual life.
So today we will understand how Krishna gives a litmus test.
Before getting bewildered just try to see whether the person is having some intelligence or not.
If a madman is giving some logic then who is interested in the logic of a madman.
Similarly before getting affected bewildered or before even beginning to read somebody's
book or watching somebody's videos or instructions you should be able to have this litmus test
whether this man is intelligent or not if he's intelligent.
So let us go ahead and analyze if he's unintelligent then we should save our
time like Chanakya Pandit save the time.
So let us read today's shlokas in this context.
Okay.
So you can see the Bhagavad Gita on the screen.
We are doing chapter 5th today we will see verse number 22nd.
Before that a quick recap of what we did in previous sessions.
So in the last class we understood
what are the symptoms of a person who is liberated.
We all want freedom when people think that oh so many rules and regulations I do not want to
follow they should realize already we are following rules and regulations now see for
last many months people are forced to sit in sites already some rules are there forces are
there people are forced to wear mark masks in a similar fashion we will be conditioned by so
many happenings changes of this world but if we follow simple rules and regulations of these
scriptures then a person gets liberated from all such upheavals.
So aim of life is liberation what are the symptoms of a person who is liberated
that we discussed in the previous session.
Liberation means he is not at all affected he is free if he gets something pleasant he does not
become very elated and if he loses something he does not become very agitated.
And how to reach such a platform that also we understood.
So this platform is possible when a person is able to enjoy spiritual bliss within the heart
just like we notice some people who get so much absorbed especially we find in colleges
or even school kids they are so much absorbed in playing the computer game
entire night they would not sleep they would not eat fan AC is running not running it is hot it
is cold they are unaffected practically for many many hours sometimes up to 15 20 or 30
hours they keep on playing or even longer than that some people for many days keep on playing.
So why they are so much absorbed that they are not at all affected by what is happening outside
my body is demanding some food they are unaware my skin is demanding some something they are
unaware. Because they are completely absorbed in the mind. Similarly Srila Prabhupada gives the
example of the great communist leader I think Stalin it was. He was supposed to undergo some
he was supposed to undergo some surgery of the intestine or stomach.
So he underwent surgery without any anesthesia told not required. He was so much absorbed in
spreading the thoughts of communism that it would not affect him. So when a person is so
much absorbed at mental level that he surpasses transients physical sufferings what to speak of
spiritual level. So when a person is enjoying the spiritual happiness
such a person will he can remain undisturbed from the external changes around us.
So unless a person has this spiritual place he is behaving on spiritual platform
bliss is required for a person. So when he is absorbed on spiritual platform then he's
totally unaffected by mental or physical sufferings. And how this bliss is possible
that also we saw secret of spiritual bliss that is only possible by
engaging in the service of pure devotee spiritual master without any reservation.
When a person surrenders completely means follows instructions as it is of a pure devotee spiritual
master who is enjoying similar bliss in his heart he also gets awakened to that bliss
otherwise it is not possible. Okay Prabhu we will enjoy spiritual bliss also
but let us enjoy some material bliss what is the harm inside also we will enjoy outside also we
will enjoy. So answer is given by Lord Krishna in this shloka that we will see now. Verse number
22 very important shloka. This shloka we use a lot in our sessions especially jijnasa sessions
the art of happiness. Lord Krishna tells to Arjuna
So Lord Krishna is telling Arjuna
please read carefully. An intelligent person does not take part in the sources of misery
which are due to contact with the material senses. Oh son of Kunti such pleasures have
a beginning and an end so the wise man does not delight in them. Again Lord Krishna is telling
very important concept if any person is there why he would delight himself in any activity which
is going to give birth to miseries later on. So now the entire training that everybody has
in today's world is to enjoy the happiness that is derived by contact of
senses with the sense objects. So Lord Krishna is telling an intelligent person Buddha
the word Buddha has come from Buddha it means intelligent. So an intelligent person Lord Buddha
was very intelligent so when he went out he saw because already the
astrologer at the time of birth of Lord Buddha he predicted
that either this person would become a great king or a great renunciant. So when a person
renounces the world in search of absolute truth when he realizes there are there are so many
miseries here so the king Arjuna Buddha should not see any misery. So what are the miseries here
greatest miseries are disease death old age. So Lord Buddha was never allowed to go outside the
palace premises and the king made sure anybody whom Buddha comes across he should not be old
should not be diseased. So Lord Buddha when he was a prince he never saw any old man he never saw
any diseased man he never came across something called death but when he grew up and a grown up
person you cannot how long can you control him when he went out he saw all these people disease
he was shocked my god disease this can happen to me also death this will happen to me also
old age I will be like this but this world is so horrible then he went to find out truth what is
this world all about who has created this disease old age death birth what is this thing and
immediately left so that is called Buddha why is intelligent so an intelligent person
does not means to enjoy to take delight an intelligent person he does not take part
in the sources of misery what is the source of misery which are due to contact with the
material senses we think contact of sense object with the senses material sense is the source of
pleasure let me put gulp down all the coffee morning to evening let me have all the nice
fast foods and all other or any regular food let me enjoy my tongue very nicely
let me enjoy my eyes very nicely so in this way we think this is the sources of pleasure
and all the earning all the hard work everything is there to satisfy the
body to put senses in contact with the sense objects but krishna is telling here
they are actually the sources of misery dhukha yonaya evate yonaya means yoni means source
dhukha means misery so this kind of happiness which obviously you get flickering happiness
for a short while this is the source of all miseries in your life
this body is called network of illusion as we have discussed in the past
some bodies think stool is tasty some bodies think halwa is tasty but ultimately these
experiences are only because of body so this body's network of illusion when a person thinks i am
this body he is illusion thinking this thing is good another thing is good this thing is bad
or like that but actually lord krishna explains that these are the sources of misery bhakti
explains these senses are compared to death only because of enjoyment of the senses a person is
dying life life after life oh son of kunti such pleasures have a beginning and an end
so the wise man does not delight in them so yes definitely there is some pleasure
but these pleasures have a beginning and an end and we are eternal when we are supposed to
enter a house or rent a house here we are signing an agreement in which lock-in period is mentioned
what is lock-in period at least this much i'll be allowed to stay you cannot throw me out
suppose a person is not willing to sign lock-in and we are living in that place and he says anytime
i will come and i will throw you out in the middle of the day in the middle of the night
any day suddenly i'll throw you out so shall we take the place we will not take it
and even if we are we have taken somehow or the other we will be very much willing to find a place
where we have some stability there is some lock-in period some agreement in place
so this is how we are living in this material world any moment we can be kicked out
so because we are eternal a wise man very clearly he can understand that i am eternal i am not
changing my body is changing each and every cell of the body has changed after a few years
but does the mother say oh you are just two percent my son
sorry you are just two percent my son 98 percent of the bodies or 100 percent of the bodies change
you are no longer my son no even though every cell of the body has changed mother still tells
oh you are my daughter you are my son she identifies us as 100 percent the same son or daughter
same child even though the body has completely changed so we are not the body we are consciousness
body we keep on changing bodily organs are very well transplanted now with the help of medical
science the blood is also transfused very easily the air inside the body we breathe and breathe out
every moment we are not the bones not the blood not the air we are the consciousness within this
body i am observing the changes of the body so i am eternal but the body is changing so if i am
eternal why should i take part in something temporary so much hard work for something temporary
so that is why an intelligent person does not take part in the source of misery
so here krishna is giving a litmus test for intelligence any intelligent person will not
take part in sense enjoyment sense gratification which is the source of all misery in one's life
this people do not realize the more they want to enjoy the senses the more they will become
depressed and harassed in their life that is why the celebrities become very very depressed
no restrictions so much of money they want to enjoy unlimitedly the more you enjoy enjoy the
more depressed you will become in this world so we have discussed many many times before
but it is always good to have this foundation very very clear so why this sense enjoyment is
not good because lord krishna will tell in the verses to come it is addictive in nature any kind
of addiction is not good addiction means i never want it in the first place but if i start using
it i cannot live without it and i want it in greater amounts with every single use people
were not watching cricket cricket was brought by the britishers so much money they were saving
but now people cannot live without cricket so much time so much money they would spend
10 000 rupees for a stadium seat they would go and spend so much time they will they will spend
so this is called anartha this is called addiction i cannot live without watching it although i never
desired it in the first place i somehow came in contact and got hooked on to it similarly drugs
similarly drinking and similarly the food that we eat similarly the things that we watch similarly
the people whom we live with we simply become addicted and addiction is not good addiction is
never satisfying it gives just temporary relief and it bites all the more and then you satisfy
the biting also increases so in this way a person people go to ccd to enjoy coffee they think they'll
get relieved but the owner of ccd could not get any relief he could have drank unlimited coffees
he was making a limited coffee but no relief so this is why it is simply an addiction you have
some material status you got some good marks now poor fellow maya has made fool of you entire life
you have to work hard to prove yourself every week you have to work hard to prove yourself in
every weekly test you have got some name fame status in the business world entire life you
have to work hard to maintain that status now you'll be pushed to work very very hard
and anyway you will never be satisfied by whatever level you attain in life because next week there
is another examination and anywhere you don't perform immediately there is distress so the
same thing which is giving you happiness that gives you distress that is another nature of
material world the same sun in winters is good the same sun in summers is hot the same sun will
give happiness this on birth the same sun will give distress on his premature death
so in material world happiness and distress are two parts of the same coin
and another very important thing is you can enjoy only in small quantity like that of a salt
so i've explained in jiggyasa sessions so those who are new can hear it's very interesting
so once a person went to a restaurant and in restaurant the food was served to him
and uh somehow the salt was less so he was suggested oh put little salt in the food and
the food will become very very tasty and he told oh really he put little salt and the food became
tasty so he applies logic oh if little salt i have put the food has become so tasty let me put entire
jar of salt in it and the food will become very very tasty so this is foolishness salt just to
that extent if it is less you cannot enjoy it is little more you cannot enjoy
just a pinch of it you can enjoy in your food in a similar fashion material enjoyment we can enjoy
only in just a pinch of it as much as is required for keeping the body and soul together
the food which is required just to keep yourself fit the soul should somehow remain in the body
then that much food that quantity you can enjoy but the moment you indulge yourself in luxury
the amount of sleep required to maintain body and soul together you can enjoy the
moment you indulge in luxury immediately distress begins sexual pleasure if it is required to create
new bodies body and soul together then krishna tells dharma i am that pleasure
but the moment we use it for sensual enjoyment then immediately misery begins
so material world is addictive material enjoyments are addictive we want to
increase but we cannot increase only in a pinch we can enjoy the moment we increase it spoils
our life so anyway in many many more other ways any intelligent person wise man can understand
sense gratification is an act of foolish people we see all those people who have done enough sense
gratification in life enough name fame success they have got they also have faced tremendous
depression and dissatisfaction for the least so if anybody is atheistic arguments he is putting
forth so you ask him okay you will not follow spiritual life you will not find absolute truth
you will not engage in loving service of krishna then what else you will do in life
sense enjoyment that anyway has not satisfied anybody it is simply another form of addiction
so then that is called foolishness
so that is why any person who is sense gratifier krishna has declared here he is not an intelligent
person because he understands this is the source of my misery so at least a person who is living
in a very very controlled way very very simple life that person would be happy
happy means he would not be affected by the material afflictions material miseries
and when he engages in loving service of god he gets positive happiness
but at least he should understand that these are the sources of misery this is called common sense
so buddhism lord buddha when he came he gave common sense religion at least this much you
can understand that material activities are leading to misery so stop the material activities at least
so those people were so dull he could not teach them spiritual activities but this anybody can
understand because we all have done material activity and we understand it never satisfies
us it makes us work hard entire life all the more and bring so much misery to our life
life so any person who is indulging in sense gratification he is a foolish person
he could be a very big scientist could be eloquent speaker could be giving many many
logics but if his aim of life is to enjoy the senses then he's foolish so that is why
so some of you share this with me prabhu please watch this video what is your take about it
please do this thing please read this thing this is the argument please identify the source first
of all that person if he is not doing this thing what he is doing in life he is simply
doing sense enjoyment and he's foolish he's a madman so what is the use of listening to a madman
a goat will eat anything and similarly a madman would speak anything so what is the use of
listening and analyzing the talks of a madman so as soon as a person we find that he has made
sense enjoyment as the only aim of life enjoyment of mind or these external five senses then that
person is not intelligent then any statement anything he makes we should not waste our time
like chanakya pandit and we should first of all that is why in the next shloka lord krishna explains
before giving up this present body if one is able to tolerate the urges of the material senses
and check the force of desire and anger he is a yogi and is happy in this world
so lord krishna is telling if one is able to tolerate the urges of material senses
and check the force of desire and anger before giving up this present body then he is a yogi
and he's happy in this world shri pravopada explains if one wants to make steady progress
on the path of self-realization he must try to control the forces of material senses
there are the forces of talk we all want to talk a lot forces of anger forces of the mind
forces of the stomach forces of the genitals and forces of the tongue one who is able to control
the forces of all these different senses in the mind is called goswami people many times
you'll find people using this title goswami as their surname so this simply by keeping title
you don't become goswami go means senses and swami means controller person who has controlled his
senses so a person who can control the forces of talk whenever he wishes he would talk
for whatever he wishes he would talk forces of anger whenever he desires he will use anger in
the service of god lord hanuman arjuna otherwise he would not use it forces of the mind forces of
stomach forces of genitals and forces of tongue one is able to control these vegas or forces he's
called goswami such goswamis live strictly control lives and forego altogether the forces of the
senses material desires when unsatiated generate anger so some people tell rabu please tell me how
to come out of anger so all the anger is because of material desires which are not satiated not
satisfied why we become angry we have some desire i should get this respect or honor
desire of five senses or mind which is called sixth sense so my mind desire so give me this
respect somebody doesn't give me respect i become angry i want this task should be accomplished
doesn't get accomplished i don't i get dissatisfied and i become angry so it is only because of
material desires that anger is produced when they are not satisfied and then mind eyes and
chest become agitated therefore one must practice to control them before one gives up this material
body so if before giving up material body person is able to control the forces of desire material
desires and anger then he will not take up another material body one who can do this is understood to
be self-realized so who can do this tomorrow we can do this no we have to become self-realized
sayogi by this sayogi can be identified a self-realized soul can be identified one who
is able to control these forces of the body
the forces of genitals tongue mind anger
thus one must practice to control them before one gives up this material body one who can do this
do this is understood to be self-realized and is thus happy in the state of self-realization
it is the duty of the transcendentalist to try strenuously to control desire and anger so will
it be easy to control it no strenuous effort is required practice is required just like you build
your physical muscles you need a lot of practice people gym a lot to develop strength eat certain
kind of food to develop muscles in a similar fashion certain kind of food food which is
offered to krishna prasadam is required to give us spiritual strength build our spiritual muscles
and thus with those spiritual muscles there are no spiritual muscles in that sense
spiritual strength even a person advances in that then he is able to control these forces of mind
and body anger and desire so strenuous endeavor is required with great determination a person has
to stick to the rules and regulations given by the spiritual master that is called sadhana bhakti so
simply a very unsystematic unplanned and undisciplined life cannot lead us to
self-realization strengthening the soul for strengthening body you need discipline
discipline in waking sleeping eating exercise in a similar fashion spiritual exercise spiritual
eating spiritual routine is required to build spiritual strength
then lord krishna mentions
one whose happiness is within who is active within who rejoices within and is illumined within is actually perfect mystic
he is liberated in the supreme and ultimately he attains the supreme so as we discussed before
he does not enjoy outside in the sense objects he is enjoying within
god is living within the heart and within his heart he is always meditating 24 hours
and he's completely enjoying a different kind of happiness with this meditation
and such a person he is liberated a person who can enjoy the happiness within not everybody
can enjoy that happiness but one who can do that he is liberated and ultimately by practicing that
increasing his meditation on the supreme lord in the heart by chanting his holy names he attains the supreme
now how it is attained it is mentioned here will a person sit in the corner so arjuna can
leave his chariot sit down and think of supreme lord within the heart so here it is told
liberation in the supreme is achieved how
one is always one who is beyond duality and doubt whose mind is engaged within
who is always busy working for the welfare of all sentient beings
and who is free from all sins achieves liberation in the supreme
so the duality is something is good and something is bad somebody's friend somebody's enemy
this is family and this is not family duality these two existences mine this belongs to me
this belongs to somebody else so these dualities are existing only when a person is in illusion
he is not liberated the doubts exist only when a person is conditioned by this body
but a person who is free from all sins since means breaking the laws of nature as i've explained
four regulatory principles meat eating intoxication gambling and illicit sex these are the foundation
of all sins so when a person is not sinful he's following all the rules and regulations very very
nicely then such a person is able to come out of doubts as long as a person is not free from the
doubts as long as a person is not free from the sins then doubts will exist so by strenuously
following the rules and regulations a person goes beyond duality a person is not having any doubt
and a person is he is always busy working for the welfare of sentient beings
and such a person achieves liberation in the supreme so many times you'll find Krishna will
again repeat this thing in the 12th chapter and other places also all the living entities are
suffering not that some people belong to me i belong to everyone everyone belongs to me
because we are all eternally connected to god we are part and parcels of Krishna
so all the living entities they are suffering here only because of ignorance
of Krishna consciousness so that is why a living entity is engaged always in the service of
the other living entities and what is the meaning of service of other living entities
what kind of bhagavad-gita arjuna understood Krishna is telling you serve others and arjuna
by understanding bhagavad-gita agreeing that Krishna yes i will follow he killed all the so
many crores of people Krishna is telling you should engage in welfare and you are killing them
that means killing is also a kind of welfare arjuna agreed to follow bhagavad-gita Krishna
will not speak bhagavad-gita to somebody who will not follow so welfare also means killing at times
nowadays capital punishment is being abolished slowly people think oh let let us have some mercy
upon the soul one mistake has happened in anger in a fit of rage he killed somebody why should we
kill him so let us give him some punishment some reformation can happen and then he can continue
they don't realize laws of nature are if you don't give him capital punishment kill him in this life
the murderer will be killed many times and will have very very horrible situation in the next life
this concept is not known that is why capital punishment was mercy by the king to the murderer
so that is why killing also can be welfare at times and the best welfare activity is the welfare
of the soul because we are not the body and we are not the mind so spreading krishna consciousness
taking a person beyond the clutches and control of mind and body it is a real welfare activity
and that in one word is called preaching spreading this message of krishna so we have to engage
so we have to engage ourselves in controlling the senses not indulge in material sense gratification
engage in the service of pure devotee by spreading this message to everybody
that is called real welfare work and when a person is in this manner engaged in real welfare work
then he is able to attain he is able to attain liberation so please do not get confused
sense gratification does not make any sense and if a person is making that as the aim of life do
not get confused by any of the statements that he makes and all the people of this world are engaged
in sense gratification thus we don't give much credit to anybody any statement so do not worry
only when you find some person has completely controlled the senses do lend your ear to hear
various words
