Knowing Ourself, Identity, Who Am I?
This session is dedicated to His Divine Grace, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, whom we call Srila Prabhupada.
Srila Prabhupada is the Founder Acharya of Worldwide Hare Krishna Movement, also known as ISKCON, International Society for Krishna Consciousness.
Today, whatever we are seeing around the world, everywhere you go, you'll find people chanting Hare Krishna, singing the names of God.
You go to Vrindavan, you go to Mayapur, you go to any place.
Whenever you see some Westerners, they cover their hands in this cloth or coming to India visiting temples.
It is all the contribution of His Divine Grace, Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.
We learn more about Him as the session progresses and in coming sessions.
So, a person is coughing very, very badly.
A very strong cough is coming.
Why is the cough coming?
A person immediately gets curious.
Is this cough due to some normal flu?
Did we come from the sun and drink cold water?
In this way, a person gets curious.
It is very important to get curious to be happy.
That's why we have named our course as Jigyasa Password for Happiness.
Just like in computer, we have to put a password.
Without this, you cannot have access to it.
Similarly, Jigyasa is called Password for Happiness.
If you want happiness in life, you have to do Jigyasa.
Without it, happiness is not possible.
Animals will not do Jigyasa.
A dog would keep on coughing if at all they cough.
I'm not sure, but they would keep on suffering from other diseases.
Even though he sees a vet and animal doctors around the street on which he roams,
he would never go inside and tell,
please help me out with this irregular behavior I'm experiencing in my body.
Please help me out.
He does not know how to inquire how to solve these problems of life.
But when a human being suffers, he inquires,
this is not normal for me.
Suffering is not normal for me.
That is why he goes and asks, why am I suffering?
Then the doctor examines him very nicely.
The doctor asks, he also does Jigyasa.
From when are you suffering?
What did you actually do?
The doctor is also doing Jigyasa.
Because unless you do Jigyasa, you cannot find truth.
Unless you follow the principles of truth,
unless you follow the principles of truth,
unless you try to know the truth,
what is the truth,
and if you do not follow the rules of truth,
you cannot find happiness.
And what is today's civilization?
What is today's civilization?
They are not interested in truth,
but directly enjoyment.
This is very, very dangerous.
Unless a person inquires about truth,
knows truth,
and then follows truth very, very nicely.
A person has got a nice car.
He wants to drive very fast,
but he does not wish to inquire
on which route I am traveling,
whether this is one way, two way,
whether there is some speed limit for it.
He does not wish to inquire.
Then he is in great danger.
He needs to understand the laws.
He needs to do Jigyasa.
It is necessary to understand that.
I am driving a car.
What is the speed limit here?
Should I keep the car on the left in this country
or should I keep the car on the right?
He needs to understand.
And if a person does not understand,
he is simply enjoying,
driving a nice car,
he is going to create misery for himself.
And then the doctor suddenly tells,
so sir, you are suffering from Corona.
There is shock.
Corona.
What is happening to people around us?
So now, further inquiry.
Corona, from where this Corona has come?
Oh, it has come from virus. From where?
Virus has come inside the body.
How it is affecting?
So, how to counteract, how to destroy this virus?
Again, inquiry.
Inquiry after inquiry. Okay, as long as
vaccine is not there. Again, inquiry.
What do I do? How can I stop?
How is this virus entering our body?
This is what people are asking.
Jigyasa after Jigyasa after
Jigyasa we are doing because
Jigyasa is very important
in order to understand truth.
Following truth, we become happy.
Thus, the Vedas tell
Vedic aphorism, Vedanta Sutra,
the conclusion of all the Vedas,
all the knowledge of Vedas,
is presented in the form of Vedanta Sutra,
through Ved Vyas,
who are the creators of Vedas,
the incarnation of God.
So, our Rishi Ved Vyas tells,
in Vedanta Sutra,
conclusion of all Vedic knowledge,
that is Brahma Jigyasa.
In human form of life, you can do inquiry.
No sir, we also do Jigyasa a lot.
We have done Jigyasa.
Why are we suffering in life?
When I see
that my neighbour has a very good
car and I don't have a car,
I feel sad.
So, how can I be happy?
How can I earn more than
my neighbour?
And then I will drive my car
which will be bigger or
bigger than that, I don't worry.
Why am I in stress?
I have less marks, I am having lesser job
than my neighbour and my friend.
So, let me work very hard,
try to write an examination
and then if I go to a good college,
score more marks, then I can show off
and then I will be happy.
I will not feel low in my self-esteem.
In this way, people do Jigyasa.
Government is investing a lot of money
in the research institutes.
In the IITs, Indian government
is putting money so that IITs
at least can reach up to
some level, some mark.
Within top 100, they should reach.
And then what causes misery?
Oh, this neighbouring country,
if they attack, they capture us, we will be
in misery.
If the neighbouring country attacks, we will be sad.
So, our army should be
very strong, our defence should be very strong.
So, let us spend a lot of money,
let us spend a lot of time on improving
our defence.
Likewise,
we also have been doing Jigyasa.
But, the report of
the World Health Organization
has been a tight
slap on the ears of all
the big think tanks of the world.
World Health Organization,
which is a very prominent organization
in the world, in the health sector,
they have given this report.
And year after year,
they are giving such reports.
Year after year, this report is of
2016. You can do
search for 2017, 2018,
2018. Consistently,
US is ranking among top three
most depressed nations of the world.
Why US is among
top three depressed nations of the world?
Our Prime Minister has
run a plan for a clean India.
America is very clean.
You won't find dust by searching.
So, some scientists are saying that dust
is very important. Without it,
immunity is going down. So, they are recommending
that children smell dust in the plate,
so that their immunity becomes strong.
They are recommending to smell dirt.
So, you will not find speck of dirt
in US. And then, we are
investing a lot of money in defense. We wanted to have
some planes from US, which US
gave to Pakistan and like that.
Now, we got it from another country.
But US is having the best and
strongest defense. India
wants to push its researchers, research
and technological institutes in
top 100, top 10 universities
of the world. Most of them are in US.
US is having
all that we are aspiring
for. We are getting metros now.
US got metro in
1940.
They were so ahead, far, far
ahead than us.
All the parameters
which can make a person
happy have failed. So, when
Srila Prabhupada was preaching Krishna Consciousness,
he attempted to preach in India.
But people would not take because it was
just India had got independence.
He said, we have got freedom now.
Now, we will earn money.
Now, we will become rich.
Now, we will become like America.
So, Prabhupada said, I will
preach in America.
Because Prabhupada knew that without Krishna
Consciousness, without his service,
happiness in Jeevan is not possible.
So, when Srila Prabhupada went to America,
in America, he saw
the young generation
frustrated and depressed.
And they were not
happy, but they became hippies.
What is hippie? Hippie means
all those people who are part
of movement called counterculture
movement.
So, despite having all the riches,
Americans, they were not happy.
So, they thought these
rules and regulations, they don't let us
enjoy. We are rich, we are
having resources, but society has imposed
so many rules and regulations
that we are not able to enjoy
our resources.
So, that is why, let us
break all the rules and regulations.
Let us defy culture and let us start a
movement, counterculture movement.
Why there should be marriage? Let us not marry.
Live like animals, mate like animals.
Like animals, enjoy, drink,
sleep on the road.
Break all rules and regulations.
We will find pleasure in breaking all rules
as we see in India.
People are saying, get out of
big institutes, be reckless, enjoy
your life, do what you want to do.
Big motivational speakers are saying,
follow your passion. People followed
their passion in the west and they became
even more depressed.
So, there is a tight slap. Whatever
parameters are being decided for success
in life, US had achieved
all those. And can somebody guess which
was the second most depressed nation
as per the last year's report?
And even before that, the country which is
going to give tussle to US, that is
China.
China will be depressed.
Capitalism, we can understand,
brings depression. Why?
Communism is also bringing depression.
Oh, we understood
because they do not have democracy.
There is no voice of the public.
We have to give voice to the public.
When the public will ask the question,
the public will get freedom.
Capitalism will not work completely.
Federalism, remove all these things.
Remove communism. Pure democracy.
Like India.
As you know, in 2018, India was ranked
as the most depressed nation of the world.
Communism may be depressed.
Capitalism may be depressed.
Democracy may be depressed.
What system is this?
What system do we follow?
Please try to understand.
This is fact. The teens.
So, they have been observing.
It is not just for last year.
I have been observing data for last
many, many years, ever since I joined
and before that, from 2009
to 2017,
depression has been
only increasing.
By more than
60%,
kids are getting depressed.
Sigmund Freud,
the famous philosopher, he gave philosophy
of depression. Why people fall
into depression? Because of something called
superego. And then he told, because children
would not fall into depression.
What is a child? A child will get hurt,
you will not give him a toy, he will cry a little.
But the child will not fall into depression.
But our civilization
did such a miracle that Sigmund Freud
failed. He said,
the children do not have superego,
so they are not depressed. We are
suffering because we developed this something called
superego. Now, children
are also in depression. Kids are falling in
depression. This is our advancement
in life. So, what are we doing
in our life?
Money is not giving us happiness.
We think, we will become CEO of the company.
The most famous CEO of the world,
Shatabdi,
was not satisfied with his
death. He told,
don't live like a twisted
person like me. Endless pursuit of wealth
doesn't make you happy. It is another
thing I am used to.
The biggest celebrity of recent times,
rather of all times you can call,
he was under great depression.
Then he thought, okay, let me make
technology, technological,
let me leverage this to my
use. Let me again
become reckless.
I am having this body. Let me change the body.
Change his gender, male to female, female
to male, male to female. He became
more and more depressed, had decades
of depression. So, the biggest celebrity
is not satisfied. CEO is not
satisfied. Those who followed their passion,
earned a lot of money,
earned name, earned respect,
but they remained sad.
So, please, whatever concept
we have, this is called brainwashing.
So, I am telling why these
sessions are so important. All
this brainwashing that we have,
we have to keep it out of our minds.
Money doesn't make you happy. The country
is sad, the individual is also sad.
Your degree doesn't make you happy.
The most depressed people
are in MIT. Massachusetts
Institute of Technology,
IIT Bombay, which is very close
to our ashram. Here, a teacher
asked the students, how many of you
are satisfied with the
allotment of branch and college that you
have? In IIT Bombay, which is
the best institute of the country, 90%
of the students raise their hands, we are
dissatisfied. So, what kind of education
system is this that is training us in such a way
that even if we become successful,
the country, we say,
even if we clear the world's most difficult exam
and get into the best institute,
even there, 90% of people are not
satisfied. People want to go
into social service and teach people,
they want to open schools.
Even if he studies,
and if he reaches the best of the institute,
90% of the probability is there
that he will be sad when he goes there.
If he goes to MIT, he will be even more sad.
Bangalore, everyone goes to Bangalore.
The city of dreams, our job is done.
And if you take the shelter of Google
Guru, Google search, you will find
Bangalore is the suicide
capital of the nation,
of our country.
You get a job in Bangalore, you get money,
you get enjoyment, buy women money,
men, everything is available.
So why suicide capital? This is called
Jigyasana. So if you satisfy
the senses in madness,
then you will become a fool.
But the Vedas tell us that if you
want to satisfy the senses, you need
happiness. Like you get a user manual,
you get Niyamavali,
in the same way, these Vedas are
user manuals for us. If you follow user
manual, you can take
optimal use of the machine.
After that, you will not get satisfaction,
but you will reach the next level
of Jigyasa. Why I am
not satisfied? What is missing in the
equation of madness?
That is why Steve Jobs, he rose to,
he came close to spiritual level.
He came to Indian search for spirituality
when he was ousted from the very company he made.
And he took Buddhist initiation
also. And obviously that did
not work. And he
continued. If you don't find a right Guru,
even spirituality will not be effective.
But nevertheless,
he rose to this level of
inquiry. So if
you are very fortunate, or if you follow
the Vedas very nicely,
then after sense enjoyment,
comes the next level.
That is called Gyanaka.
Adhi vi kyu dhukhi.
Kyu satisfaction. So let me
share that story with you.
The Srila Prabhupada explained
in MIT, Massachusetts.
The Srila Prabhupada told the story
of two friends.
Scholar and abortment.
So,
two friends live in a village.
And one friend gets a chance
to study.
He studies very nicely, and then
eventually makes his abroad to a very good
institute. And he comes back
after becoming a very great scholar.
And they are supposed to cross a river
to reach their village. And on the
bank of the river, he meets
his very old friend.
And they become very
happy, hug each other,
change everything in the readings.
He says, I was here, I did
this thing, that thing, scholarship, so many
degrees, what did you do?
I couldn't do much, I only
sail the boat.
Let's take you to our village for free.
So the boatman
sits in the boat.
And the other friend who could not
do much, who simply remained a boatman,
he starts sailing the boat.
And obviously,
why are we working so hard?
In the morning, we had a small session.
So some people are watching,
they have taken their new hairstyle.
I didn't see their hair in the video.
So people are taking advantage of the lockdown.
Maintaining hair is a genre,
hair loss is the biggest cause of depression.
Let's get some relief for a few days.
Let me give away my hairs.
So people were sitting without hair.
Some people were sitting with their hair extended.
Otherwise, they would
have very nice trimming of hair,
spend hundreds of rupees for it,
and shave nicely on this thing.
So most of the things which are depressing
people today is
endeavor to show off to others.
This is what we are living.
This is called brainwashed. If we analyze,
it is not very difficult to understand.
We have a life to show others,
and if we can't show others, then we are depressed.
That's it. Nothing else.
So he also started showing off.
So this caller asked the boatman,
You see these trees
on the side of the river?
He said, yes, we sail. We watch it every day.
He said, do you know botany?
We don't know botany.
He said, do you not know botany?
Your 50% life is waste.
Oh God,
50% is wasted.
What should I do? Anyway, we sail.
He sails and goes ahead.
Then the boatman says,
My dear friend, you see this water?
He said, yes, we sail.
We watch it every day.
Do you know fluid mechanics?
We don't know that.
Do you not know fluid mechanics?
Your 75% life is waste.
Oh God,
75% is wasted.
What should I do? Anyway, we sail.
He sails and goes ahead.
In the evening, we see stars in the sky.
He says, My dear friend,
You see these stars in the sky?
Do you know astronomy?
He said, we don't know astronomy.
We don't know astronomy.
Your 90% life is waste.
Oh God, 90% is wasted.
In this way,
your entire life is wasted
in depression.
And then
dark clouds appear in the sky
and heavy rains start.
And when heavy rains
start, the scholar asks
the boatman, My dear friend,
what is this happening?
He says, we don't tell you in foreign.
We don't know.
But it is raining very heavily.
We will drown.
He says, why will we drown?
The boat can drown.
We will swim across.
Swim across.
But I do not know swimming.
I do not know swimming.
Not 50%, not 75%, not 90%.
Your 100% life is
waste.
The boat sinks down.
The boatman tried to help, but
he swims across and the scholar
goes down with the boatman.
So what is the moral of this story?
So Srila Prabhupada explained,
knowledge is definitely important.
There are various fields of knowledge.
There is knowledge of engineering.
In engineering, there is computer science,
mechanical, electrical, civil, etc.
So many things.
There is knowledge of medical science.
There is knowledge of commerce. There is knowledge of
industry, management.
So many laws, so many fields of knowledge.
But the knowledge is of relative
importance.
If I do not know how to make PPTs,
I can manage.
But if I do not know Bhagavad Gita,
I cannot manage. What will I speak?
Home science is also a science.
How to cook food, how to
cook, how to sew, that is also a science.
Home science is called.
But if a person does not know home science,
the work will go on.
But if there is no medical science in society,
oh my god, what shall we do?
There will be a problem.
So medical science is important than home science.
So Srila Prabhupada told
those students of MIT,
Massachusetts, that you are
the brightest brain of the world.
Any machine breaks down.
You can fix it.
Suppose our friend
is going in a car and the car
meets with an accident. What shall we do?
What will we do? Whom will we save?
Will we save the car or the friend?
We will save the friend.
If there was a dead body in the car,
would we save it? No.
Friend is living.
Or even he may not be a friend, he is a person
he is living. Car may be getting
destroyed, it's okay, but the person should
be saved. It is life which
is very very valuable in this body.
Yes, if you understand the
science of ophthalmology, if you understand
science of cardiology,
science of neurology, all this is important.
But there is one thing which is
most important in this body.
Like I told the people at MIT,
any machine breaks down, you can fix it.
Car breaks down, you can fix it.
Any automobile breaks down, you can fix.
Tape recorder doesn't work, you can fix.
Washing machine doesn't work, you can fix.
But when the most important
machine breaks down,
why you are not able to fix it?
Which is that most important machine?
That is this human body.
When it breaks down, when it
stops working,
why can't you bring it back to work?
When the car stops,
and then it stops, then you open
the bonnet, you do some research, and then you
fix it, it starts again.
Computer is not working, it starts again.
Two years ago,
in IIT Bombay, Sophia
came. She came,
I don't know what to say.
It looks like a female, it's a robot.
So Sophia came,
and then she got stuck in the middle,
the robot, and she stopped talking.
The internet connection was disconnected, some problem was there.
And then it started again.
So it stopped, a robot stops, you can fix it,
it will start again.
But when the human body loses consciousness,
why you cannot bring it back to
consciousness?
Close a person's mouth for 3 minutes,
he will die.
He will stop all activity.
The air has gone out of the body,
we have ventilators,
why can't it come back to life?
What is missing from the body
that the person can't come back?
And that is the most important
thing in this body.
Just like if there is a USP attack,
they first take the president to the White House.
He is the most important person
of the country, he is running the country.
So saving the president, this
art, this science is of paramount importance.
In the same way,
if there is no awareness of eyes in the body,
it will work.
If there is no awareness of the body,
liver, kidney,
it will work.
If there is no awareness of eyes in the body,
it will work.
Without civil engineering,
a person can live,
even dogs can live.
But if there is no awareness
of consciousness,
there is an animation in a robot
to put a battery.
What does our body contain
because of which consciousness comes?
And if that consciousness goes away from the body,
then even family members
will put the body out,
so this is consciousness
which gives value to the body.
Without it, there is no use of the body.
And where is the science of consciousness?
Where does it come from?
Where does it go?
Why are you not studying this?
It is this thing which is
most important in this body,
consciousness. And Prabhupada told,
this is what is missing in today's education.
That is why the best CEO
was depressed,
the most famous celebrity was depressed,
and the most advanced nations
of the world are depressed.
Because you have studied science,
but we have understood
how to cure all diseases,
but we could not understand corona.
That is why people are still dying and people are sad.
We did not understand one thing.
In the same way,
we did not understand this one thing.
That is our knowledge about us.
We are souls, different from the body.
We did not understand ourselves.
That is why we are sad.
This is taught in Vedic education.
That is why this life has been given
to us to be curious.
Even animals are curious.
I agree with you, Prabhupada.
We are curious,
even animals are curious.
But the curiosity of animals is
limited to food, sleep, fear,
eating, eating, sleeping, depending
on how to satisfy the body.
How to satisfy the body
that is different from the body.
Our state can be understood
only by the intellect of
the human being in human life.
That is why the scriptures say
that it was taught in Vedic education.
Animals are only curious about
Taktva, understanding Taktva,
understanding truth, understanding Brahma.
Human life is food, sleep, fear,
eating, eating, sleeping, depending on
which hotel you are going to eat,
where you are going to go,
which company you are going to go to,
which man you are going to marry or divorce,
that you will get more happiness.
The happiness of the body, the happiness of the body,
the happiness of the mind,
in which matter this body has not been given
to be curious. This body has been given
to be curious about Brahma.
The soul is curious about us.
And until we are not curious about this Taktva,
we will be baffled
in our attempts
for happiness,
for knowledge,
for success.
So what is the proof,
Prabhu?
We have to understand the soul,
we are different from this body,
we are the soul. What is the proof?
So Srila Prabhupada explained very nicely.
First of all, you understand
possibility.
Let us go step by step.
Can we be different from this body?
Is it possible that
we are not the body?
Is it possible? Let us discuss the possibility.
So it is very, very easy
to understand if a person is a little sober
and sane.
If he gets time out of the office,
sitting peacefully,
removing his notifications,
thinking a little,
then he will be convinced about this possibility.
Example given is,
the way we go in dream state,
when we are dreaming,
in dream we hallucinate that
I am the body, a different body of dream.
Sometimes we are flying in wings.
And we are seeing
we are falling from the mountain.
There is a lion behind us.
We are late.
We are eating something very well.
We got success, we have become kings.
This kind of happiness and sadness
hallucinates in the body.
We feel that we are in the middle of trees, birds,
river, walking on the road,
touching people,
talking to people.
In dream we have very real
experience.
In dream we never realize that I am dreaming.
In dream I think I am having
a real world,
life, it is reality.
Only when we wake up
we understand, oh, that was not real.
Sometimes we lose our sweat.
So what is the guarantee that
you are still not seeing a dream?
A dream is a dream only when
we come out of the dream.
If the dream always goes on,
we will never understand
that it is a dream.
Are you all with me in this point?
If the dream always goes on,
you will never understand that it is a dream.
If it breaks, you will understand
that it is a dream.
If you always keep on dreaming, we will never
understand that it is a dream.
Only when it breaks we understand it is a dream.
So that is why nobody
can tell whether I am dreaming
or I am having real experience.
Experience is real here
and experience is real in dream.
So Shasir tells us, just like
in dream you think you are
a body, which is not fact.
You think you are a body
and experience is real.
The same is written in Shasir.
You think you feel
that you are having,
you are living in a real world
and you are this body.
But this is also hallucination.
That is subtle hallucination.
That body is made of subtle elements.
The body of dream is made of mind energy.
And this body is made of gross
elements.
But we are not both these bodies.
So the possibility,
if a person is confidently saying
that no, no, we are this body,
where is this soul, then he is
fool number one. He cannot understand
simple logic. You can never
tell whether I am dreaming
or I am living in reality.
You can never tell it sir.
Experience of this world and experience of dream
is exactly the same. It is a real experience.
Now the question is
what is truth, what is reality?
Whether I am dreaming or I am in real world.
This was a subject matter
of study for the original
scientists and philosophers
of the 14th-15th century.
And always, modern history I am talking about.
In Vedic times, people were much ahead
in their Jigyasas. In modern times,
they were taught in school.
And if a person thinks a little,
then he will understand the rest of the proofs.
That is why people used to say,
what is the truth? What is the truth?
Is life real or are we living in a dream?
So first proof, now let us study.
There is a possibility that this is also
not reality. I am dreaming.
Now how to understand that I am dreaming?
First of all, Srila Prabhupada explained
introspection. If you do
little introspection,
Prabhupada explained to the students of MIT,
simply you analyze.
This is called Sankhya. You analyze.
You tell my hand.
You tell my finger.
You don't tell eye hand, eye finger.
You tell my head. You tell my body.
You do not tell eye body.
If you are telling my body, then where are you?
This is my specs.
These are my specs. These are my
headphones. This is my
computer, my system. So I am different
from computer. I am different from my specs.
I am different from my headphones.
Similarly, my hand. I am
different from hand. My head.
I am different from head. If you remove
one hair from your body,
will you die? No.
You will continue to exist.
If you remove a finger from your body,
will you die? No. You will continue to
exist.
So I am not this body.
So I am not this body.
Eyes.
Eyes do not see.
We see through you.
If you donate your eyes to an American,
will you start seeing America from the next day?
No.
The way we use glasses,
in this body, soul
uses this lens.
Which is called eyes.
Eyes are not seeing. We are seeing.
If you remove these eyes and put on other eyes,
then only you will see through these eyes.
If you see these eyes somewhere else,
if you send them to another city,
then you will not start seeing another city.
So please understand, we are
different from the eyes. Eyes can be
replaced. Does eye replacement
change a person? No.
So we are not eyes. So what are we
in this body? Are we
liver? Liver also gets transparent.
Are we kidney? Kidney also gets transplanted.
Are we heart? Heart also gets transplanted.
Are we blood? Blood
gets completely transfusioned.
If we leave air every second, then what are we in this body?
Everything in this body
can be changed. Like
the engine of a car can be changed.
Carburetor can be changed. Wheels
can be changed. Seats can be changed.
Everything can be changed.
In the same way, body is a machine.
Krishna says in Bhagavad Gita,
yantra rudhani mayaya.
This body is a machine.
And you are the one who drives this machine.
Just like the driver drives the car.
So if we simply, are we
the brain? No.
For consciousness, the brain is not needed.
There is life in trees
but there is no brain.
Jelly fish, there are
many fishes and other animals
that eat, drink, sleep,
give birth to children
but there is no brain in them.
So we are not brain also.
We are the life.
So consciousness
is not because of the way Sudapapa told.
This consciousness is the most important
subject matter and if you analyze
you will come to the understanding that
you are that consciousness.
So does the world exist or not?
Is this world real or a dream?
We will understand all this later.
But we exist
because we are able to think.
It is very easy to understand this.
I exist because I am thinking.
So I am not this body.
It is very easy to understand because simple.
This body can be changed
even medical science also says
that before they used to say that in 5 years
the body's whole cell changes. Now medical
science says every year
almost all the cells of your body are
renewed. But you remain the same.
You remember you had a 2 feet
body, now it is 5, 6, 7 feet.
But you are same, you are observer.
Body is changing, you are
observing. You are that observer.
You are that observer who is not
changing even in changing the body.
So introspection is very easy.
The whole body can change the organs
but we are not changing.
This is very easy proof.
Socrates
understood Socrates like this.
He was not a Vedic scholar.
He is the leader among the
western philosophers. Socrates, Socrates
understood that I am not the body.
So people were not able to understand the soul at that time.
So people asked what
knowledge do you give to people?
So if you think you are not the body
then bring this poison.
He told okay I will drink poison and he drank
poison. He took hemlock and died.
Because he was convinced I am not the body.
If a person is little sober he will
understand he is not the body.
But there are many more proofs. There are
NDE, near death
experience.
Now time is little less so I will go little
fast. Maybe in future
we will try to cover these case studies and
topics. So many many people
who in clinical observations were
dead and they came back
to life. They gave witness
that what is happening in the operation theatre.
One case of Pam Reynolds, a
woman. She was a songwriter
and I think a singer also.
She died in 2010 I suppose.
Very famous case.
She was brain dead in clinical observation.
Heart rate also
became zero. ECG
zero record. There are zero pulse.
And in that situation she told
what they were discussing. How they were standing
next to my body.
What things they were using. What conversation
was going on. And they were shocked.
The surgeon was shocked. How when none
of the things were happening
in their ears they put
some phones, some ear buds because
she could not hear. It was producing very loud
sound. Even if
understood that all reports were wrong and she was
conscious. But no. Pam Reynolds you
can study the case. And many many such
experiences are there. Their body is clinically
dead. And they give witness.
Doctors what they were speaking about.
So consciousness is existing beyond the body.
Many many evidences are there.
Evidence is ghosts.
If anyone has doubts then many many
temples are there in country.
In Rajasthan, what is that I think?
Mahindipur, Balaji. Near Jaipur.
So if anyone has doubts then go there.
And if you want to talk about it
then you can also stop there.
It will be a practical experience.
So time is little less.
In future sessions I will share some
ghost stories and existence of ghosts.
We have many many such encounters.
And by Hare Krishna Mahamantra right
from the time of Srila Prabhupada till in my
personal experience we have chased away
many many ghosts. I will share in future
classes. So ghosts do
not have gross body but consciousness
is interacting with this world
without any gross body. So this is the
proof. Then another proof
is reincarnation.
Dr. Ian Stevenson, he was
sponsored, his research was sponsored by
the founder of Xerox.
And lot of money was given
to him actually to prove
that we don't reincarnate.
This was the original intent. And he was
the director of one very famous
medical college. You can do research
about it. And you know
he started his research to
disprove the fact but he
rather became convinced that
reincarnation is a fact. And he
has written many many books. He did
elaborate case studies. He did not
belong to some faith. Christian faith
doesn't even believe in reincarnation.
He is not Indian. And he was not a
Vedic scholar. But he did research
scientific research. You can visit on
the web ianstevenson.com
Ian Stevenson. You can see the name
is written. And many many case studies and he
tells the most promising evidence, the
most strong argument
is because these
proofs are coming from children.
You cannot train children to speak all these things.
People are speaking languages
which are extinct.
How do we understand that? There is a boy
who bore witness to his killing in previous
life in Bolan Heights in Syria.
There is a video about it. I cannot
show you now because video streaming doesn't have
to nicely over it. So please all of you
join our telegram group. I'll share the link
because another means we cannot
mail thousand people.
It will be spammed. So please join our
telegram channel by the name
Bhagavad Gita as it is. I've shared the link. On that
I will share some other content related
to today's topic. So that more clarity
will come. So you can see that video
also. So he has done elaborate
research on reincarnation and if you
read, you'll be convinced that reincarnation
actually happens. And
I personally have met people
who have memory of their
previous lives. I have personally
many such encounters.
We have positive time so
Bhavishya Meski Charcha karenge.
This video I'll share.
And
sare doubts ko hataiye. Sapse important
hai to hear
authorities.
If I want to understand science of
mechanical engineering, the best
is to approach a mechanical
engineer or faculty of mechanical
engineering. Ussi tarike se agar
unko samajhna hai ki sate kya hai.
What is truth of life?
Then I have to approach people who have dedicated
their life to find truth.
Today nobody is interested in
truth. Unki jigyaasa wahi
tak hai. Kaunsi research karein
jiski funding ho jaye, jisse
paise mil jaye, jisse start-up ho jaye,
jisse hum name fame kamane.
Aisi research jisse humko name fame
paise nahi milenge, waise research
we are not interested in.
This is the affair of today's work.
Apna defense kaisi karlein, usse
research hogi. Apna khana kaisi
achcha khaalein, usse research hogi.
Apna ghar kaisi achcha banalein, ahaar, nidra,
bhaim, aathun, eating, mating, sleeping, defending.
All this research is based around
these things. There is no fundamental
research about truth. But entire
Vedic civilization is dedicated
for this. Jeevasya tattva
jigyaasa nartho yascheha karma bhi
manav jeevan mila hai keval
aur keval tattva jigyaasa
sate ko samajhne ke liye
aur jeevan ka koi purpose nahi
because sate ko samjho gaye nahi, sate ka
palan nahi karo gaye to, sukha kahan se
milega. This is common sense.
So this is, so that is why agar
anko sach ko jaanana hai, so we have to
refer to Vedic authorities because
Vedic education ka keval ek purpose hai
sach ko jaana, Brahma, jigyaasa,
jigyaasa, aur koi purpose
nahi hai. So that is why
we have to listen to Vedic
authorities. Ono ne apni jeevan dedicate
kiya hai. Onko khaane peene ke liye
kuch nahi chahiye. Jungal me
rahate the reishi muni samajhne ke liye, sate kya hai,
sate kya hai, maaste vikta kya hai, reality
kya hai. So Bharat
varsh is cheez ke liye famous hai,
log, rupya, paisa, dhan, daulat,
pariwaar sab chhod ke
sate ki koj mein jaate ki sate
kya hai. So that is why
agar anko, jis tarah se
automobile ka knowledge chahiye, we have
to approach automobile, faculty of
automobile engineering, agar
anko computer ka knowledge chahiye, computer
science faculty, agar anko truth ka
knowledge chahiye, faculty of truth, that
means Vedic authorities.
Aur Vedic authorities yahi kaiti hai
what to speak of Vedic authorities,
every bona fide religion
it be Christianity, it be
Islam, it be Sikhism,
it be any bona fide religion,
sab believe karte hai ki hum ye body nahi,
hum soul hai, jis body se ka
peeti alag hai. So what does
Bhagavad Gita say about soul?
Bhagavad Gita kuch nahi, soul ke baare
mein hi batata jaata hai, body ke baare
mein bhi gyan hai, but soul is
important and that is why the most
important instructions are about the soul.
So saare instructions abhi hum charcha nahi
kar paayenge, Jagyaasa workshop ke baad
ye sab hum detail mein samjhenge, abhi
ek shlok leke is class ko
khatam karenge, jo ki bahauti
zyada sabhubhi hai aap sabhubhi hai.
O shlok kya hai? Krishna Arjun
to tisre adhyaane, by listening shlok
mein batata hai. Third chapter, verse number
forty two, indriyaani paran
miyaho rindriyabhya param manaha
manasastu parabuddhir
yoguddhir paratas tu sahar.
To Krishna Arjun ko kaiti hai,
indriyaani paran miyaho rindriyaani
hum indriyo ke baare mein sochhte rehte hai
we are always wondering about the senses
how to satisfy the sense
and sense satisfaction is taken as the
aim of life. So Krishna is telling
no, indriyaani paran miyaho
this body is made up of various
energies. Just like the fan is
operating on various energies
there is a mechanical motion because of
the fan is running, but behind the
mechanical motion there is invisible
electromagnetic field. So behind
this material field which is
made up of some metal, some tin
there is electromagnetic field
which is making this gross thing move
so this fan which we are seeing
this operation, there are so many
energies involved. Similarly in this system
many energies are in action
senses, this body is the grossest energy
indriyaani paran miyaho rindriyabhya param manaha
higher than the sensual
energy is manaha, mental energy
mental energy, mental platform.
agar aadmi ka senses bahut achche se
satisfied hai lekin mann mein khed hai
if a person is having mental
stress then
any amount of bodily
happiness will not satisfy a person
I think all of you should agree with me on
this point. We are very rich, we are
sitting in nice house, in nice location
but if we are
fought with a family member or if family
member has passed away, boss has
scolded, none of those things will give us
comfort and if mental level there is
comfort especially young boys and girls
when they have affairs
humne ghar chhoda hai khushiyon ko chhoda hai
dhur jayenge and they leave everything
why because there is mental
happiness so they don't worry
about gross discomforts of life
foolish civilisation
gym mein jaari hai, indriyo ko satisfy kar
nahi koshish kar rahi hai, na mann ke baare
mein knowledge hai, na higher knowledge hai
and mann ke level pe energy stop nahi hoti
hai, manasastu para buddhi
I think the second line
manasastu para buddhi, mann ke baare buddhi
intellectual energy
that is why the brahmanas
the philosophers of Vedic age
not by caste, this is wrong
philosophers were called brahmanas
and even some scientists, they would not
marry, Prof Abdul Kalam
could not marry, never got time
out of research, he was so much absorbed
so when you are in intellectual
pursuit, jigyaasa, what is truth, what is
truth, what is truth of life
you don't need even mental pleasures of life
these emotional things and all other things
a person doesn't care
that is why many many brahmanas, they will remain
nasty brahmachari and take sannyas
they don't want mental happiness also
because they are having intellectual happiness
satva jigyaasa
we are doing, thus many
people ask, how to control these
strong urges of the body, unless you
do jigyaasa, urges of the body cannot be solved
and higher than intellectual
level is one more level that Krishna tells
yo buddhe paratastu sahaa
higher than the intellectual level is
paratastu sahaa
that is you Arjun
you are higher than your intelligence
we choose whether
to use intelligence or not
should I solve this question, no no no
another question would be easy
this is tough, let me leave this question
not use my intelligence, let me use my
intelligence to solve this question, I will get
more marks, so I
choose where to apply my intelligence
intelligence is controlled by me
I observe the intelligence
we analyze
our intelligence
we analyze our mind
I want to meditate but I see mind as
one somewhere else
I am different from mind
very easily we can understand by simple analysis
I am different from body
that is simply understood, I am different from mind also
I am different from intelligence also
Krishna tells yo buddhe paratastu sahaa
and because
there is no happiness
at intellectual level
no happiness at spiritual level
all the modern material arrangements
of so called intellectual pursuits
also, mental happiness
also and physical happiness
is not satisfying people because
there is misery at the spiritual
level and how
the misery of spiritual level can be resolved
that science Krishna explains
to Arjuna in Gamba Gita
mama evanshu jiva loke jiva
bota sanatanaha
you are my Anshar, eternally you are simply forgotten
just like a person can
forget his wife and children when he meets with an accident
it happened in Jaipur, one of our donors
he met with an accident, forgot his wife
now when he sees his wife
there is no special pleasure in his heart
because he has lost his memory
in a similar fashion, we forget
Bhagwan, to take the body
that is why we do darshan of Bhagwan
if we take His name, then
there is no love or compassion in the heart
so until we
revive this relationship
we are not connected to Bhagwan
we will not find happiness
just like a leaf goes in a tree
just put the leaf in the tree
the leaf will become green
let the finger stay in the body
the finger cannot be healthy
in the same way, without the service of Bhagwan
you become a very big spiritual
person
you can control a lot of senses
but if you do not serve Bhagwan
then you will not be successful
that is why it is written in Bhagwatam
atmaramas chamunayo
people who are in the state of Brahm
are in the state of Mukta
Atmaram is completely
satisfied in itself
bo bhi kurvanti ahaitukim bhaktim
hittam bhut guro hari
they also become forced to serve Bhagwan
so in serving Bhagwan
there is so much happiness
that is why Krishna says
vedesh ca sarvair aham evivedyo
all the knowledge that we read
in physics, chemistry, maths, civil engineering
material science, martial arts
this is also in the Vedas
people used to make houses in the Vedas
while eating and drinking
doctors used to do it in the morning
we know the motion of the planets
that is why we can make a calendar
but the conclusion of all this knowledge
is not to earn money
Krishna says aham evivedyo
so that is why we request you
please try to take this happiness
it is very very simple
most of you are born in the age of technology
you are scientific minded
so we request you
please make an experiment in your life
please do this simple process of chanting
and hearing the names of God
and then you will see automatically
all the knowledge will come
and unlimited happiness will be revealed
and when you will get that
then corona, death, disease
will not trouble you
when Arjuna was worried
Krishna did not give any solution
Krishna said to Arjuna
Arjuna, there can be no happiness in the physical world
because I have made this world
Dukhalayam
creator has put a seal
this world is house of miseries
so there is no possibility of happiness
that is why we request you
please understand this
our brain has been washed
please get out of this washing
whatever you speak is logic
spirituality is not blind faith
so because of Krishna
they can understand Krishna consciousness
science of spirituality
so I request all of you make an experiment
follow this simple process
and relish the spiritual pleasure in your life
so please understand
we are different from this body
we have dedicated our life
to satisfy our body and mind
or intellect
this knowledge
gave to the hippies of America
they became hippies
they used to come and go
but they never got so much happiness
they never returned to their country
so there is definitely a factor in this
we have some other groups
but time is running out
so we will try to share this
