So a person may wonder especially in our country where there is entire politics is based around
religion entire media so many people they are able to make their livelihood basis these conflicts
which are created of this world religion so one may wonder what is this religion Hinduism Islam
Sikhism Christianity Buddhism Jainism so many isms are there so what is this
which is correct whom to follow so actually if you pick up any dictionary and try to figure out
the meaning of word religion it translates as some kind of faith so generally when we speak of
religion in some forum people often synonymously use it with the term faith so it is faith it's
a matter of faith Hindu faith Islamic faith or some other faith however the actual world is dharma
in Sanskrit which in English they have translated as religion and religion means faith like that
so that is not the exact meaning of the word dharma before we demystify all the dharmas which
are present in the world let us try to understand what is the meaning of this word dharma so the
word dharma is not faith faith is something which a person can change many people they convert
especially in mumbai we see where we live so a lot of conversion is happening and many many people
they convert you please we'll give you some ration we'll give you money we'll give you
xyz and then you convert into our religion and then people get converted very easily
on the promise of some money and some other facilities so a faith a person can change
his faith the famous celebrity he was following one religion and then his father got sick
and then he prayed to god and nothing happened so he changed his religion
so when people think just like you go to any shop and you do not find the desired product that you
want you are able to change your shop okay let me go to another shop i'll pick it from there i
don't get sugar here let me go to another shop and get sugar from there in a similar fashion
sometimes when their desires are not being fulfilled people think oh this god is less powerful
so let me move to another god he'll grant my wishes that god is better this god is apparently
busy so many people are there asking him so this is not the actual meaning of the word dharma faith
we can change but dharma is something which is called intrinsic characteristic
which cannot be changed which is inseparable
dharma
is it possible that someday we have a cold fire or a dark fire no it is not possible fire means
heat and light inseparable characteristic sugar means sweet is it possible that we have bitter
sugar someday oh the sugar is bitter sugar no then what kind of sugar it is sugar means it
should be sweet
dharma is something which cannot be separated from that thing that is called dharma
so like this if we analyze then a person should ask then what is my dharma what is something which
cannot be separated from me from hindu i can become muslim from muslim i can become sikh
from sikh i can become buddhist from buddhist i can become xyz so these things i can change so
this is not actually dharma as per the shastras dharma means something which cannot be changed
which is inseparable from us so what is that thing if we analyze something which cannot be changed
so shlita prabhupada explains the dharma the intrinsic characteristic of human beings
we do not want to follow rules and regulations
why to get up early in the morning let us have night life work in the night and then sleep in the
daytime and then eat whatever i want so there is one order of spiritual priests so-called
spiritual priests which are which is very very famous in our country and their leader is quite
glorified in our country and they the sannyasis over there they are eating meat and they are
ordering food from swiggy and zomato and everything and they watch movies and they have just a very
regular thing what any other materialist would be doing they smoke they do all these things
and when somebody asks them sir you are having a cigarette and you are drinking and you're watching
all these not so good videos and why you're doing this thing you're a sannyasi no no no no
so this is another category so actually people want to break all the rules and regulations
they want to experience freedom in this but shastras tell us no sir there is no freedom for
the jiva for the living entity
one man is going to office working very very hard so that he can take care of his family he's
serving his family members the mother is taking care of the household duties now even mothers are
working both are working so that they can serve the family a student is there yes he is also not
free he has to serve the teacher serve the rules and regulations of the institution of the school
we have to serve our boss in the office or if you're having your own business then you are even
greater servant then you have to serve all your customers so still you are servant so like this
if you analyze nobody is free in india we have at least some family still there two three people
live in a house we call it family but in west
they encourage him to earn from 14 years so they have no family so instead of serving family what
do they do they serve a dog and the man is dead and the dog is super rich this is what happens in
western countries so a person needs somebody to serve why the dog is passing stool and you
are standing guard to him there is some pleasure in serving the animal also when animal reciprocates
you feel very very nice so it is all dharma which cannot be separated and suppose there is nobody
still a person is servant he's servant of his senses sometimes eyes will demand oh show me
this thing you have to show helplessly a person may be very very smart very very advanced but he's
servant of his senses eyes are demanding something and the person is servant of his eyes
immediately he'll fulfill a video yes yes one more let us see one more pop of us come okay let
us see this also let us see third also fourth also and then we realize and we have spent all
the time uselessly we have to provide music to our ears and the ears never stop demanding they
keep on demanding give me more give me more we are servant of our tongue we get pulled by the tongue
helplessly servant of reproductive organs servant of belly servant of skin and servant of all the
senses so we were talking of freedom yesterday people are working people have worked very hard
that we want freedom and in some countries still they are working no we want freedom this rule is
not good but sir where is freedom even if you are able to change so-called ruler you are helplessly
being ruled by your own senses helplessly you're serving the senses you have no freedom the senses
pull us in some direction and we get pulled away very very easily and thus a person's situation his
life is very very miserable this is the biggest illusion
there is never any pleasure if they demand you do some service what happens you have worked very
hard in the office then boss may give you some vacation okay go on go have some vacation he'll
give you some bone or something but the senses are such unworthy masters they demand even more
service the senses are never never satisfied that is why the most famous celebrity of all times
was not satisfied satisfying his reproductive organ thus he changed his gender more than i think two
times male to female female to male male to female he was trying to enjoy without any restriction but
senses they never stopped demanding at the poor fellow he spent decades of depression so the more
you serve the senses the more you come under depression thus we see the opportunity to satisfy
the senses they are so many now in this world earlier there was no even television no movies
people which were just dramas now television came and so many channels came and then and now
on the click of your finger you have everything what you have to wait for the series to come once
in a week on your television so now so much opportunity is there for sense enjoyment but
we see depression in society has also increased in that proportion so the more we this is very
important point we have to come out of this training so this is called freedom this is not
the vedic education vedic culture in vedic culture person will be taught to regulate senses because
by regulating a person becomes free so a person has to serve if he is not serving his family members
if he is not serving some animal he has to serve if not customers if not subjects he has to serve
his senses
so that is why real freedom is using your dharma nicely following sanatana dharma we discussed in
the first session who am i that we are different from this body we are sanatana we are eternal god
is also eternal god means topmost power so nobody can kill him put to death god is eternal
we are unsure of god part and parcel of god so we are also eternal
he may become
very erudite scholar he can do very nice chanting he can do very nice austerity
but in his chanting in his tapasya in his good family good birth if in a scholarship if is
missing then it is told it is like body without life it is decoration of dead body
so any efforts in our life to become a very wise man to become a rich man to have very nice to do
again mystical powers magical powers all this thing is decoration of dead body the powers will
remain with the dead with the body and this body is dead this body is moving because we are living
in this body so suppose you become very great scholar as soon as you leave the body entire
scholarship is finished now again you have to start your studies from the beginning you got
various mystic powers you are doing magic from your body as soon as you leave the body all the
yogic siddhis they would be left behind so all these materialistic endeavors are decoration of
dead body you became very rich ceo of the biggest company of the world and then you become dog in
next life in the same company then what is the use of such an endeavor so that is why religion
means that it is very different from the word dharma what we see so dharma means to do seva
and ultimately unless a person reaches sanatana dharma so sanatana dharma is not some sectarian
religion it is very different from what people perceive as hinduism sanatana dharma means engaging
in sanatana eternal relationship with god and that only satisfies the heart of living entity
it is that pleasure for which we are hankering and unless a person gets that pleasure then he
demands eyes will demand tongue will demand all the organs will demand give me this give me this
give me this and the person will never be satisfied so just like when we eat so much then we don't want
to eat anything else so when a person is established on sanatana dharma this platform
then only he is completely peaceful then nobody can engage him in service just like all the
devotees we don't do any job we don't do anything nobody can make us do any service we are free
free of all the other desires that is why nobody can engage us in service so thus we can see
very very practically how it works so it is the mercy of Srila Prabhupada that we have got all
this wonderful knowledge so we dedicate this session to his divine grace AC Bhaktivedanta Swami
Prabhupada our spiritual master and the founder acharya of worldwide Hare Krishna movement
so when ultimately we have to follow sanatana dharma there is only one thing which will satisfy
the living entity then what is this so many people claim that i am son of god and they have created
various places of worship everyone is telling i am son of god we should love god but so many
religions they have created in this name and especially in one religion which is very
prominent in our country we have so many deities so many devatas so a person may get bewildered
why so many gods are there you are telling god is sanatana one we are also sanatana eternal
but so many gods who is sanatana who is eternal among them so any sane man will have these
questions
so wish what is fact what should i follow moreover everyone claims
so we have to understand just like sun is one there is no american sun indian sun or african sun
although sun is seen everywhere sun may be known by different names somebody may call him surya
or somebody can call him sun in a similar fashion god is only one god means the supreme power
so supreme the origin of the origin of the entire world so god is one however the same god is
addressed differently in different religions somebody may call him allah somebody may call
him father in heaven or krishna supreme personality of godhead yahweh so many names can be there so
all the bona fide religions and scriptures because they are the word of the god so please mind it
bona fide religions we are talking of here not all the religions so religion means dharma
the instructions of god they are called dharma anybody cannot create dharma many many bogus
religions are also there but bona fide religions they being the word of god the essence of
essence is same all the bona fide religions they tell god is one no good religion will tell god is
god are many we have to develop love of god nobody tells hate hate god we have to obey god's laws
we should not commit sins sin means breaking the laws of nature and we have to glorify the
holy name of god so as we have been discussing this process of chanting on the beads that is
common in all bona fide religions so-called hinduism or islam or christianity or buddhism
or sikhism chanting on the beads that is a common process rendering service unto god as
soon as people approach a place of worship a religious place they want to do some service
they are very eager and we have to go back to the kingdom of god every religion tells the same
thing father who lives in heaven allowed be thy name so we have father also lives in some place
and we have to go there so it is simply out of egotism that people tell no no god means simply
some some energy something is floating how there can be a person who can create universe
because i cannot create universe so i think nobody can create universe why just like an ant ant can
create an anthill we can create skyscrapers and cannot imagine such a structure so just like we
can create skyscrapers and few countries like china is creating islands they can create island
similarly somebody can create planets also what what's the big deal in that and that person also
lives somewhere he has a kingdom why should float in there like a ghost so we want a house to live
this tendency is coming in us because god also has a tendency of living in a house so god has his own
place his kingdom of course that place is very very advanced so these things are common we have
to chant the names of god glorify him render service return to the kingdom of god don't commit
sinful activities
the message is given by god or his representatives
the
so different level of mathematics are there if it's a simple example
just like an elementary school student
2 is the answer
so then he'll start crying how can reduce so he does not know
the negative thing is not possible for him to understand
it is possible it is three but when he goes to high school
the negative integers become a fact minus three he learns that it is unavoidable in his study of
mathematics or same then he will study cross product dot product
so this is the level of mathematics all are studying mathematics only but as per their
capacity teacher may be very bright all the messengers may be very highly realized
but teacher instructs as per the capacity level of understanding similarly different bona fide
religions teach same principles but according to time place and circumstances
just to have a comparative analysis
so jesus christ
so
10 commandments you just follow which are the 10 commandments one commandment is thou shall not
kill please stop killing a killer is so ruthless he cannot have a soft heart he cannot have
proper understanding of fire concepts so jesus preached just for two to three years he did not
preach much and so much opposition is god he got for his simple teachings which were the teachings
of jesus thou shall not kill thou shall not go with thy neighbor's property don't do adultery
so all these very very simple things he preached and he told thou shall not kill and people kill
jesus only so this was the caliber this was the empathy that people display towards such a noble
man he is trying to elevate society help them and he's telling you are preaching wrong things
so we will kill you only first of all so he had hardly any followers two three hundred followers
two three years he preached and they crucified him for this simple thing on the other hand
shreemad bhagavatam was spoken to exalted sages so which are these sages who have dedicated
their lives to find the absolute truth so just like if you have various colleges so how do we
understand which college is a good college or a better college it depends upon the caliber of
students when we were supposed to choose college we were seeing so the opener or the person who
has got best rank which college he's choosing which branch he's choosing because we cannot
do any other thing this is the best criteria see where the most intelligent people are going that
college is best college there you go that you choose so similarly in our comparative analysis
of religion all the bona fide religions are important as per capacity pre-primary school
kindergarten primary high school higher secondary all grades of study education are important
however high school or higher secondary school is higher than primary or pre-primary levels
so here we are trying to understand which is that high school or higher religion so we understood
christianity and all other religions they were taught to what kind of people my lord buddha came
so lord buddha gave this teaching to the people who are indiscriminately killing and they are telling
we should kill the animals no animal killing is not recommended in the vedas that is a special
process by which in yajna proper very very highly qualified brahmana the animal when he sacrificed
he immediately gets a fresh body young body and just like people who are sick they are operated
and they are able to live longer so an animal immediately gets a fresh body
and immediately the animal is promoted to human form of life so this is very nice for the animal
also animal is not killed but rather he's rejuvenated that is called bali so immediately
the animal would get a new life it is not that sometimes people may argue are you following the
veda
immediately he's rejuvenated to a fresh body the science people do not know so when people
could not understand the science behind the yajnas and they indiscriminately started killing
animals krishna came as lord buddha as we saw in the incredible vedas lord buddha is incarnation
of krishna and then he taught this basic religion at least become non-violent then you will have some
sanity to understand sanatana dharma or higher things so shreemad bhagavatam if we see to who
was bhagavatam spoken to barbarians who were meat eaters and not caring about others pains
no bhagavatam was spoken to people to parishit maharaj who is parishit you see the person who
is sitting and listening to shukde goswami who's sitting on the asan vyasa asan elevated chair
so the person who is sitting with folded hands receiving instructions he is maharaj parishit the
grandson of arjun and maharaj parishit was the emperor of the whole world 5000 years ago
and he's emperor and he got a curse that he's going to die in seven days
just like there was some poll on the internet so people are asked if you know that you are going
to die soon in seven days or so what will you do what will you do so people are telling i would do
bungee jumping i will see london sigh and so many other things weird things they are trying to do
let me enjoy senses there are movies also made on this so a person knows that he's going to die for
some disease or whatever and then he is fulfilling all those desires he's trying to visit this place
and he wanted to have his name published in newspaper and he's trying for that and then he
wanted to propose a girl and that girl is already married he's going and proposing and then he's
trying to fulfill all these desires and people are glorifying wow just see and those people who
are helping him to fulfill these desires so they are telling this is such a nice philanthropic
work however parishit maharaj not a foolish materialist like that as soon as parishit maharaj got
to know that he is going to die parishit maharaj understood no i am different from this body this
body has been given to me for a purpose just like every machine is created with a purpose
so i have not fulfilled that purpose in this life yet so how can i fulfill that purpose in seven days
purpose is self-realization to develop strong attraction towards god like we have for our
friends and family member even much stronger than that so unless that is done process of birth and
death is not stopped over and over again we have to take birth now we have human birth if you become
animal how horrible life is now if you are sick we can we can go to doctor animal cannot even
approach doctors and how we kill animals that is known to all of us animals are boiled in
boiled alive in water to take out their fur and skin and it is very very horrible the animal's
life always in anxiety another animal can kill me human being can kill me so life is very very
horrible so human life is meant only for one purpose this science is not known to people
some science they know that if disease happens how to avoid disease but if death happens how
to avoid death that science is not known death happens because of some biological cycle
and that can be surpassed using vedic sciences human life is only meant for that purpose in
this machine we can stop the process of repeated birth and death so there is no question of disease
or any other misery whatsoever so he told now how can i fulfill that purpose in seven days
so immediately parishit maharaj went to the bank of ganges that i have just seven days left with me
what to do so all these sages you see them sitting in the audience yes are a rishi muni
is planets in a just like somebody shared with me a video of the ufos jo pentagon
bona fide video they saw some ufos eight to ten years ago or even before that
oh that is fact these videos are bona fide so universal travel is established fact so
bhagavatam mentions
is
the duty of a person who is about to die we all have a duty here
agar kui bhi aadmi apni duty enjoyment duty ke saath aata hai agar aapko paise kamane ka
enjoyment chahiye toh aapko duty karne padegi aapko high responsibility lene padegi toh
ussi thre se hum is duniya me sirf enjoy kar rahe ho duty ko bhul chuke hai isli hum luk
safar kar rahe ho jivan mein all of us have forgotten our duty if you want to enjoy citizenship of
a country you have to do fundamental duties also enjoyment is never without duty so he
told what is the duty of a person who is about to die and then the sages also were not having
clear opinion that in seven days how we can fulfill that objective of self-realization
freedom from all the laws of nature developing strong love for god then immediately shukde guswami
shukde guswami son of vedavyaas liberated personality from birth he was so much advanced
in yoga siddhis he would not allow his body to expand and come out of the mother's womb
and for how many years i think 16 years he lived in the womb of the mother and then finally vedavyaas
was requesting please come out he told no i will not come out
then he was given assurance and then finally comes out and as soon as he came out he was totally
unattached he started walking out of his house and vedavyaas is crying he's trying to stop him
my son please please stop please hear but he walked out he never looked back so he was liberated
personality from the birth and as soon as the sages saw shukde guswami they understood
he is most advanced spiritual personality on the planet so they told parikshit maraj he will give
you the answer so then the answer came in the form of shreemad bhagavatam so once your bhagavad
gita is finished you all can start reading shreemad bhagavatam if you read one hour every day it will
take four to five years to complete shreemad bhagavatam is the crux of all the vedic knowledge
so this is the difference between the instruction which lord jesus gave and what was given by shukde
goswami this is the difference between bible and bhagavatam we are not putting anything down we
are just explaining one thing is meant for one kind of audience another knowledge is meant for
higher audience so it was spoken to people all these sages you are sitting they have dedicated
their life to find what is truth what is truth what is truth of life so jesus christ told his
followers john 16 chapter 12 psalm i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear
them now it is unbearable for you
what we are studying for maths emil khanna such thick book
he will leave immediately school but slowly
so jesus told his followers there are many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now
on the other hand lord krishna instructs arjun in bhagavad gita very nice shloka seven chapter
verse number two
in completion so krishna is not speaking like lord jesus christ who is also a pure devotee of krishna
we consider him our spiritual master but krishna is not speaking he's not expressing helplessness
no he's telling i am explaining complete
complete knowledge realized knowledge scientific knowledge to you
if you know this knowledge in future never again
nothing remains to be known in future so it is arjuna if you understand this knowledge of bhagavad
gita nothing further remains to be known i have explained everything all the principles of perfect
knowledge in completion sorry so thus we can see jesus tells i cannot tell you everything you cannot
be here krishna is telling i'm explaining everything to you so just like a pocket dictionary
and complete dictionary is there small words you'll find everywhere here small play dear bear
but some words hedonism cataclysm catastrophe you'll find only in sorry few words you'll find
only in big dictionary small dictionary will not have all these things so what is happening in
today's world when people who are having various religious affiliations they fight with each other
what is the fight for pocket dictionary is saying that hey cataclysm there is no such word hedonism
there is no such word your book is useless burn it remove it so if there is no word in your dictionary
it means this word is wrong so we have to understand the way a small child is told 2 minus 5 is wrong
for a small child it is wrong to use a pencil it is used as a chalk slate in nursery kindergarten
for pencil use carvate if he uses pen or then he'll get punishment in school so using pen is
banned for that child using calculator he cannot do in exams that is cheating but the same child
when he grows up if he uses pencil then he'll get punishment when he goes to college if he does not
use scientific calculator he cannot pass his examination so something which was considered
crime which was a sin that is a must in higher classes
so what to speak of those religions even
so
when the devotee shows he has got brahminical characteristics
and all the various features which a brahmin is supposed to have
then we can set our foot inside the altar
he is very simple he is very truthful he is honest he is very very clean he is having
knowledge of the vedas he is realizing knowledge of the vedas he will never do a job
a brahmana his only work is to find what is truth
he to educate others worship god and teach others how to worship
this is the duty of brahmana he will never accumulate money if he has excess money he
will give away he'll do charity in turn this is called brahmana always keeps himself in
poverty-stricken condition he wants to practice dependence upon god
so what to speak of so that is why
that is why just like for a small child these things are not allowed in other religions
deity worship concept is not introduced
so for a beginner just a few things are mentioned of spiritual life introduction to spiritual life
so beginner cannot understand spiritual forms spiritual affairs
you are not indian you are not american you are not man you are not woman you are
spirit soul at least understand this concept
so that is foolishness it is not allowed to you but it is recommended for them
so shreemad bhagavatam tells
so ultimately we should follow dharma do our duties very very nicely this is called dharmashankat
so thus in order to solve this dharmashankat if you are confused which religion to follow
so many religions are there so bhagavatam simplifies it please understand
which leads a person to bhakti of adhokshaja
means a to z or sensual perception which is describable by words
adhokshaja means which our senses cannot perceive
we cannot see the form of god with these eyes
we cannot hear his voice with these ears
we cannot touch him with these words
we cannot understand him with this intellect
that is why it is called adhokshaja
for that we have to spiritualize the senses to understand him
so bhakti means bhashdaat or service
which engages us in his loving service
that dharma is parodharma that is topmost dharma
and how should that bhakti or service of god be?
once a week we go and serve god
or only on janmashtami or ram navami day
apratihata ahayatuki
apratiha means uninterrupted
we have to serve god for 24 hours
whatever we are doing
the way we serve our family, our nation or our senses
from morning till night
in the same way topmost religion means
which engages us in service of god from morning till evening
ahayatuki
and this bhakti should not be haituki
that i am serving god with which i get promoted
we talked for a long time about this
are you chanting or not?
why?
i have never done bhakti in my life
so what happened?
after that i suffered
so some near and dear ones
some relatives passed away
and some other bad things happened in life
so he told i lost faith in god
that i am doing bhakti of god
i am engaged in service
so bhakti should not be for any return
so don't make god your supermarket
don't make god your order carrier
we engage in service of god
just for god's pleasure
that is called love
so any religion is called topmost
if it engages anybody
in uninterrupted and unmotivated service
i am chanting not because i want some pleasure
i am chanting because
god is incarnated in kalyuga
in the form of his name
i want to serve god
he is my eternal relative
mother does not think that i should serve child
because child should do something
that is spontaneous
although that relation is also not pure in material world
but just to give a crude example
in a similar fashion
service of god should be done simply to serve him
for his pleasure
why should we do this?
serve boss
boss is good in appraisal
why should i do this service of god
whom i cannot see
and morning to evening i should serve
what is the benefit?
so bhagavatam tells in the last line
yaya atma suprasidati
because only by this thing
you will be pleased in the heart
you will get pleasure
so jis pleasure ki hum talash kar rahe hain
jo hum indriyon ki seva karke
iski seva karke iski seva karke paana chaate hain
wo pleasure humko bhagawan ki seva mein hi mil sakta hain
so isliye
the purpose of this life is
some reporter asked prabhupa
so prabhupa told purpose is to enjoy
but people do not know how to enjoy
so we are teaching them how to enjoy
so enjoyment is only there when a person
engages in service of krishna
then he need not serve anybody
then he is completely free
nothing is disturbing such a person who is engaged in
bhakti of adhoksha ja
then a person's heart is so much pleased
so it is not some imaginary pleasure
sentimental pleasure
just like you put some sweet on tongue
there is pleasure
similarly a practical kariye life mein
jaise hum bata rahe hain bhakti karke dekhiye
and then you will feel tangible pleasure
in your life
so basic instructions
you find in all the religions
do not steal, love everyone, forgive your enemy
but high level instructions
you will find in shreemad bhagavatam
what is high level instruction
queen kunti, she is praying to krishna
kunti marani pandavon ki maa hain
inka poori jeevan mein itne zyada trouble rahe hain ko
but still
jab krishna wapas lot rahete pandavon ko
settle karne ke baad
kunti marani ke husband chale gaye when she was very young
she had to raise children
that too in jungle
and then there were so many life attempts
and then all the younger pandavas, their sons
next generation, they also got killed
all of them
so she had a very very miserable life
toh koi normal aadmi
atheist ban jaayega ki krishna ki ham
but kunti marani
when krishna is returning
she offers some wonderful prayers
kunti marani tells
material world ka wapas darshan nahi karna padega
toh kunti marani ke rahe hain
ki humare life ki jo success hai
wo sirf aapke baare mein chintan karna hai
aapke dhyan mein magne rehna hai
aur aapka dhyan
bhauti pragaad ho jata hai
jab hum vipdaon mein hote hain
toh please bhagwan humare jeevan mein
aur bhi zyada vipda hone de deejiye
so just see what is the level of prayers
kisi dharam mein aapko
kisi aur religion mein aapko prayers nahi milenge
jaha par koi devotee
kusht do life mein vipdaon hone do
jabki itni sari vipdaon
already life mein ho chukiye
similarly Chaitanya maha prabho
hum log prayer karte the
just like I was educated
in Christian school
so father we thank you
for the light and for the pleasant morning light
and we chant some prayers
and we ask father give us our daily bread
yeh de do wo de do aaj jo bread di iske le
thank you kal firse bread de dena
that is also good at least people are approaching God
it's not bad but that is not highest
that is not love
so Chaitanya maha prabho he offers very wonderful prayers
na dhanam na janam na sundareem
hum log mandir mein jaatein
kisle jaatein
bhagwan thoda paisa de do paisa kam hore hai
promotion de do dhanam
bhagwan followers de do
Chaitanya maha prabho kya bol rahe na dhanam
bhagwan mujhko dhanam
mujhko bilkul paisa nahi chahiye
toh kya chahiye aapko aapko chahiye
log aapko follow kare na dhanam
followers bhi nahi chahiye
toh kya chahiye aapko aapko sundar wife chahiye
na sundareem kavitam wa jagadish
yeh kaam hai I don't want beautiful wife also
then what do you want
achcha aapko moksha chahiye
aap dharam samajh gaye hain
mujhko moksha bhi nahi chahiye
moksha bhi swarthi log chahatein
moksha bhi aapka pleasure hai
jab aapko bhautik jagat mein indri tripti se sukh nahi mila
then you want moksha
you are not satisfied serving your senses
then you want moksha freedom from
this materialistic enjoyment
but that is also selfish desire
so janmani janmani shware
I don't want moksha also
let me take birth over and over again
I have only one desire
bhavata bhaktir ahay tu ki tvayi
I just want
unmotivated service for you
with great love I should engage in your service
so thus we can see
these are the prayers of
bhagvatam and the bhagvatas
who follow the bhagva dharma
we can understand all the religions
they are telling we should love God
so when Srila Prabhupada was asked
that Prabhupada
when people of different denominations
nationality or religion
they would approach Prabhupada
what should I follow, which religion should I follow
so Prabhupada told very simple thing
our proposition is whether you are a
Christian, Muslim or Hindu
simply try to understand God and love Him
saare dharm boltein
bhagwan se prem karna hai hamko
only when we love God a person is free
free from birth, that freedom
from all the powers of this world
laws of nature do not act upon
that person
and that gives a person highest pleasure
so Prabhupada told simply
try to God and try to love God
understand God
whatever you follow
so Jesus Christ and Mohammed
two powerful devotees of Lord
they have done tremendous service on behalf of Lord
we have great respect for these two great preachers
they were pure devotees of God
so our business is not that we convert
a Hindu to Christian or Christian to Hindu
that is not our business
any religion you will profess does not matter
I want to see whether you have got the result of religion
the result of religion is you will love God
just like
you know we tell, ok whatever you want to do
whatever course you want to do
you do, but ultimately you should get
job, that is the result of
good education
similarly there is no need of confusion
the purpose of religion is to develop love for God
and have self realization
understanding you are different from body
and having strong love for God
so whichever religion you are following
if you are able to develop this feeling
that religion is perfect
and if you are not able to develop, please follow this
people have been following
and they are able to develop love of God
so thus it is my humble request
this is the aim of life
all the dharmas as per the caliber
understanding of people have been introduced
so that by following religion
the course
the rules and regulations given by God
they can come to spiritual understanding
of life
when we follow rules and regulations very nicely
we will understand I am not the body
and then slowly we will develop love of God
and when we develop that
you will see how nice the life is
