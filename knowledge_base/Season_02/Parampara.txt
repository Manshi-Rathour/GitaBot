So we discussed yesterday the most important factor in spiritual life and that is satisfaction
of a self-realized soul spiritual master. So by engaging oneself in the service of the spiritual
master, a person can make tremendous advancement in spiritual life. So whatever we are doing from
morning to evening it could be our sadhana what we call it actually that sadhana is also obeying
the instructions of the spiritual master. Our sadhana is successful because we are doing the
sadhana as per the instructions of the spiritual master. The spiritual master has told you should
get up at this time you should offer things in this way you should follow this procedure
so that is why we are simply trying to follow his instructions. So thus people tell can I
chant this mantra can I chant that some other mantra and so many questions. So the answer is
very beautifully given that we will discuss more in our jijnasa session which we are going to have
next week the basic modules which is the foundation course of bhagavad-gita. So there is very beautiful
shloka throughout the vedas and it says whatever mantra you can receive it is mentioned definitely
in the vedas it could be mentioned but if it is not received in
sampradaya or proper guru parampara. So guru parampara means a chain of guru and his disciple
who becomes next guru he makes another disciple as next guru in this way guru shishya parampara is
coming down from supreme lord krishna himself.
If you take any mantra but it is not coming in this guru shishya parampara then it is
nish phala mantra te nish phala smritaha mantra te nish phala mataha. Padma puran garg sahita
all the scriptures tell the same thing. So you may read bhagavad-gita you may read various books
you may follow any mantra which you have read anywhere that mantra definitely will have effect
but it will not lead us to perfection of self-realization unless we have received it
from a spiritual master who has come in this guru parampara. So this guru parampara is completely
spiritual and the mantra is also spiritual so the spiritual mantra descends in this spiritual means
in the spiritual succession so it is very very important to find a spiritual master who is coming
in one such guru shishya parampara then it will be effective otherwise also it will be effective
just like the typical example is given of ajamil those of you who are conversant with the bhagavatam
so very nice instance is mentioned so there was a brahmana as we had discussed last week also
his story he fell down from his position because he brought a prostitute home and he told his
dutiful wife to leave the place by simply eating the food cooked by the prostitute the person
lost all his nashta sadhachara he lost his all good behavior and by losing good behavior he
performed all kinds of sinful acts which a person can or cannot imagine but after all these things
what happened at the time of death he had done devotional service nicely but he could not continue
so devotional life is any time person can fall down from his exalted position so we need to be
always very very cautious and conscious just like now how much we are cautious oh i should not touch
this i should not touch that if i have touched i should use sanitizer i should not go to my eyes
ears and face a person is so cautious because if you come in contact with the virus you infect the
virus what will happen you will get diseased and disease may not manifest immediately it may take
two days five days ten days fifteen days like that to manifest that is called incubation period
in a similar fashion some people tell prabhu what is the harm i am hanging out with my friends
with other people my family they drink they eat non-veg they do other kinds of activities but i
don't get involved no sir you may not be getting involved but you have contaminated the virus
you are in their association getting contaminated by rajaguna and tamaguna so down the line it is
incubation period you will also develop such activities and you will not realize when you
have got into such things so that it is told the first duty of vaishnava is to keep his association
very very nicely you should be very very cautious just like a person is cautious no no no virus i
should not touch virus so i should not touch rajaguna and tamaguna so night time is tamaguna
let me sleep early person should be anxious i should not be up beyond nine o'clock or nine
thirty or ten o'clock i should sleep by that time now it is tamasik time i am contacting tamaguna
and tamaguna means low mood depression animal life helplessness so i cannot do every time i
am getting forced to do same activity i am suffering no control over self laziness
uncleanliness and all these things they develop so a person should be very cautious oh no tamaguna
should not be there let me sleep early and a person should be very very cautious to use sanitizer to
come more in contact with water soap sanitizer that is purifying so whatever is satvik a person
should be very very eager i should associate with the satvik things the first satvik thing is the
morning time it is full of satuguna so a person should get up early in the morning
brahmurta brahmurta is one hour to one and a half hours before sunrise that time it starts so that
time a person should be up out of the bed and philip rahupada explains even materially a person
will be five times more effective in his studies if he does in the morning that time whatever you
wish to do five times more effective so thus people will get up early in brahmurta they would
study all the brahmacharis and students in our gurukul that we have so the boys over there they
get up 2 30 in the morning so there's the time a person should be up in the morning and associate
with the satvaguna where else do we get satvaguna everything around us whatever we see or we don't
see this we will discuss if we conduct sessions on 14 chapter of the bhagavad gita it's all about
three modes of nature krishna describes this science beautifully how this entire world is
made up of nothing but three modes of nature three energies are there so a person should
try to cultivate you should leave tamas and rajas and go towards light so i should be away from all
the tamasic things all the rajas what is tamasic thing the old things rotten things like drinks
they are made by when the food gets rotten and old so all these vines and other things they are
all the non-vegetarian food even onion and garlic people tell it is vegetarian why prabhu you are
telling we should not take because it is having rajasic and tamasic effect upon the body so thus
we are supposed to abstain from these food stuffs so rajas and tamas they are very very dangerous
it is because of rajas and tamas that a person has greed a person has anger a person has lust and all
these negative tendencies in the body the people the people could be tamasic could be rajasic could
be satvik so we should associate with satvik devotees or should the satvik pure devotees
and be very cautious i should not associate much yes a devotee is very very friendly he has good
relationship with all people but he does not maintain intimacy intimate connection with
the people who are in rajaguna and tamaguna so when a person is in rajaguna and tamaguna then what
happens then lust and greed increases in the body anger increases in the body and then the
person is destroyed he commits sins sinful activity so coming out of sins is very very important for
advancement in spiritual life and that can happen by various processes are there to come out of the
sinful reactions just like a person who has murdered somebody then how can he come out of
that sinful reaction he has got contaminated capital punishment manu saitha says other dharma
shastras are telling so as we discussed it is not wise to let him free because future times he has
to suffer at least four times if he is not killed in this life itself that purification is required
for him just like a person who goes very mad electric shocks are required for that person
other people can be trained by some counseling some tranquilizer some other medicine but a person
who is very very mad electric shock is required so a person who is grossly sinful he has killed
somebody then it is very very important to give him capital punishment that is actually mercy
a treatment for the person to bring him out of contamination this science is not known to people
so ajamil when he chanted the name of krishna very very purely then he came out of all the sinful
actions so even though you may not have received this mantra in parampara but if you chant this
or any other thing it will get you rid of all the sinful reactions of the past
but that also should be offenseless there are 10 offenses while chanting the holy names
first offense is to blaspheme the devotees who have dedicated their lives for propagating the
holy name a person should not blaspheme the devotee as krishna told we discuss last to last class
even though a devotee may be seen to perform some sinful acts in the beginning
still he is to be considered sadhu you cannot criticize the devotee for that
so if a person is blaspheming criticizing people who have dedicated their life to
spread bhagavad gita this knowledge then that is an offense holy name does not tolerate
these people are my servants and he does not respect my servants so that is offense
second offense is to consider the names of krishna to be equal to to consider the names of devatas
demigods to be equal to or independent of the name of lord vishnu sometimes people tell it is
equal you can chant vishnu you can chant any other name of any other devata it will have the
same result but shastra still no that is not the fact that is also offense if you are treating
commissioner of police on the level of a constable constable should be given respect if you don't
give respect that is improper but commissioner should not be treated like a constable
so that is an offense if you are doing like that so this is third offense is to disobey the orders
of the spiritual master and to consider him as an ordinary person if a person thinks that spiritual
master is just like any other human being who by following some practices he is respectable now in
society no spiritual master should be considered superhuman how superhuman as we discussed
elaborately yesterday spiritual master should be sakshadharitvena he should be considered on the
level of god the respect that we give to god the same level sakshadhari the same respect is supposed
to be given to spiritual master because krishna tells in the end of shreemad bhagavatam 11th canto
spiritual master is non-different from me you should think acharya is me only my manifestation
krishna is sitting in our heart and guiding us willing to guide us what to do but because of the
action of rajoguna tamoguna we are not able to listen to krishna sitting in our heart so he
manifests himself as spiritual master outside so spiritual master is an empowered personality
who has got power of supreme lord himself so he should not be considered different from god he
should be considered superhuman super spiritual master doesn't come here under the laws of karma
he's a liberated person he's coming here just to carry out the instructions of god to spread this
knowledge to people so that people can become very very happy in this life and solve all their
problems of life so considering spiritual master an ordinary human being krishna tells
don't consider him to be an ordinary mortal and asuya means a person should be non-envious of
spiritual master sometimes people envy why you are worshipping a human being generally we cannot see
anybody's getting so much respect you're worshipping and okay god you are worshipping
that is fine but you are worshipping an ordinary human being like god you are doing his aarti you
are offering incense to him flowers to him what is this why you're worshipping ordinary person
maybe very respectable person but why you're worshipping so krishna tells us who yeta do
not be envious please do not be jealous that nobody worships me why somebody should be worshiped no
sarva deva mayo guru we worship very many many devatas we worship lord ganesha we worship
goddess durga we worship varunadev varunadev kartikeya ayapa so many demigods devatas we
worship then we are not envious because devatas are worshipable denizens of heavenly planets
so it is told sarva deva mayo guru so the spiritual master he's sarva deva mayo he is
the representative of all the demigods so there is no need of worshipping various devata there are
33 crore demigods one demigod is in charge of one planet so like this at least 33 crore planets
should be there in this universe because one devata is in charge of one planet in this material world
so how you can worship all of them by worshipping guru so simply by worshipping guru a person
worships sarva deva mayo all the demigods so please do not be envious of guru puja so guru
puja is very very important so spiritual master is not an ordinary person so so this is third
offense when a person thinks guru is an ordinary mortal fourth offense to blaspheme the vedic
literatures fifth offense like this there are 10 offenses you can search online 10 offenses against
chanting the holy names so even though a person is not having a spiritual master but he has chanted
offenselessly like ajamil did then immediately he can be washed of all the sins and as soon as
a person is free from the sins he is very very happy all the miseries in our life they happen
because we have contaminated rajoguna tamoguna in the past and we have broken some laws of nature
we suffer only because of past sinful life just like why a person is suffering in the jail because
he has broken laws civil laws civic laws he has committed some crime that is why he is
being given punishment in the jail in a similar fashion on the mental level intellectual level
or physical level all the suffering that we have got is only because of past sinful activities
so when we chant offenselessly the name of krishna we will get free of all the sinful activities
but still freedom from sinful activities and getting out of material tribulations is not the
ultimate benefit that a person can get by chanting Hare Krishna Maha Mantra or any mantra
whatsoever which is mentioned in the vedas the highest benefit that a person can get by chanting
the holy names is not just the negation of miseries but it is to have positive knowledge
of spiritual life positive pleasure of spiritual life just like there is pleasure at gross level
there is pleasure at mental level also in dream we enjoy so much of mental pleasure in
dream we are eating gulab jamun in dream we are meeting somebody we are going somewhere going
places in so on mental platform also we enjoy and similarly there is enjoyment on spiritual platform
also and we are spirit souls that is unlimited just like mental happiness is much more than
gross happiness and mental distress is also much more than gross stress gross stress a person can
tolerate but mental stress he cannot tolerate he jumps from the building commits suicide so
spiritual happiness similarly is much much much more than even mental happiness and it is this
spiritual happiness for which we are hankering because that is not there in life entire life a
person keeps on trying to satisfying the senses unlimitedly but senses have limitations so he is
frustrated so that positive knowledge of spiritual life and positive pleasure of spiritual life
a person can get only when he receives this mantra from a proper samprada from a proper parampara
otherwise it will have no spiritual effect in your life so thus it is very very important to
have a bona fide guru now we have got a bona fide guru we are chanting 16 rounds but still i can
have some past tendencies some i'm still committing some sense breaking the laws of nature
so krishna tells don't worry because you are always engaged in service of krishna
following rules and regulations nicely you will come out of it but as long as we are not out of it
we cannot be always happy as soon as we break the laws of nature the four regulatory principles
no meat eating no intoxication no gambling no illicit sex especially then immediately we come
under lower mode suffering mental depression anxiety and all the other things they start in
our life and as soon as a person commits these he breaks the four regulatory principles he comes
under control of rajoguna and tamoguna and then what happens then he gets confused bewildered just
like when virus enters the body contaminates the blood a person gets confused sometimes
he's not able to see the world clearly he's not able to taste the food properly food is bitter
he cannot perceive the reality in a similar fashion as soon as we break the regulatory
principles we break the laws we commit pop we get contaminated by rajas and tamas
and then proper understanding of krishna or even spiritual master what is right in life we do not
get so as long as we are not free of the sinful actions it is not possible to understand spiritual
life doubts will always remain what is right what is wrong so just see have you established
yourself in satvaguna very very nicely you are very satvik you are very peaceful senses are
perfectly controlled mind is controlled you are not being pulled by the senses and mind you are
controlling the mind and senses you are very honest you are very truthful you are very very
clean these are satvik qualities and if a person is not able to come to satvaguna in this life then
this is the contamination which he has got of rajaguna and tamoguna few bodies are given which
are called paap yonayaha which are called impious births so when the body is contaminated by rajaguna
and tamoguna the bodies which a person will get those bodies will not be suitable for spiritual
advancement so brahmana body is punya yonayaha that is suitable body for spiritual advancement
brahmana again i repeat those who are new it is not as per caste kshatriya is not as per caste
just like doctor today there is no caste you do mbbs mdms whatever and then you practice and then
you will be called a doctor in a similar fashion those people who are philosophers educators who
research about absolute truth worship god and teach others how to worship they never do any job they
are called brahmanas we should have these qualities so thus as per the qualities society has been
divided engineer doctor similarly vedic culture divides in brahmana kshatriya vaishya and shudra
so brahmana and kshatriya raj rishis they are considered punya yonayaha they can very easily
understand what is god what is aim of life and follow very nicely for others it is very very
difficult that is what lord krishna is explaining in today's shloka so let us try to read the verses
so i'll share the screen now last three verses are remaining in the ninth chapter
this session is dedicated to his divine grace ac bhaktivedanta swami prabhupada
shri la prabhupada is our spiritual master and founder acharya worldwide harikrishna movement
thus we can see how entire world is now chanting harikrishna any country you go any tribe any
religion christians jews muslims atheists theists every person buddhists jains everyone is chanting
harikrishna mantra all of them they picked up why these people especially jews christians muslims
they picked up before so-called hindus picked up because this mantra which prabhupada sang it came
down in parampara so prabhupada being a pure devotee when he chanted it immediately vibrated
in their hearts and they got rid of rajas and tamas immediately they were able to understand
what is spiritual life so krishna now tells verse number 32
oh son of pritha those who take shelter in me though they be of lower birth
women means merchants as well as means working class can approach the supreme destination
oh son of pritha oh i'm sorry how much greater than are the brahmanas the righteous the devotees
and saintly kings who in this temporary miserable world engage in loving service unto me
so here we see krishna is describing some births which are not considered pious
so which are those births so all those people who are working working class
so in vedic culture nobody would do jobs because that means i'm dependent upon other person
so only the shudras who are very very uh unintelligent who would never go to school
they would pick up jobs means business class which are considered most intellectual people of today
leaders world leaders any person can make some money and people think oh let me see his advice
on every issue he is actually intelligent man after in doing studying lot of science also people
want to make money and that is a criteria for intelligence if a person has good package he
can make good money do good business means he is more smart but that class is not considered very
very advanced as per lord krishna the creator himself so these are papayonia when a person
does not have proper punya in his previous life then he gets birth of working class or business
class or three are women for women also it is difficult to advance in spiritual life
because rajas and tamas is more that is why we see women are very much attached
so this attachment is a great deterrence for spiritual advancement so because of high rajaguna
and tamoguna so in these classes it is difficult to make spiritual advancement
however lord krishna is giving here so that is why bhagavad gita has a universal appeal
it does not matter your qualification pre-qualification disqualification does not
matter even though by regular vedic process these people cannot be elevated to spiritual life
in this life you have to do your duties very very nicely and then next life you can get a proper
birth slowly a kshatriya birth brahmana birth in brahmana birth your intelligence is very
sound your senses are very very controlled self-realization is very very easy but not in
this life very difficult to follow however krishna consciousness is transcendental because it is a
completely spiritual process so these are the designations of the body ultimately soul is same
it could be within man or woman or shudra or vaishya or brahmana or cat or dog or snake or
alligator or whatever the soul is same so if the process is spiritual it will appeal to everyone
so krishna tells
i deliver my devotee from the clutches of this repeated birth and death this ocean i give him
knowledge if he is not intelligent he does not have developed intelligence then i give the
intelligence to that person who is always engaged in my service so thus this bhakti yoga is so nice
at whatever platform a person is it does not matter some people tell prabhu
your process is little tough regulations are tight i cannot avoid all these things let me
follow gradual process so sir gradual process is not possible gradual process was followed in
previous yogas so there are some rules and regulations for you shudra should follow this
vaishya should follow this other should follow this chandala should who cannot follow the other
unions they belong to so for everyone there were rules and regulations gradually you elevate
yourself but now it is not possible that system is lost however we have a system which is very
very powerful and it can act upon everyone krishna tells as per the social norms you can
discriminate this is having good birth he's having or she's having empires birth but it does not
matter but one condition is there what is the condition they should take specific shelter of
mine not not anything else if they are completely surrendered unto me then all the disqualifications
they are set aside is highest destination all of them can attain highest destination
if only this render completely unto me become my devotee because he saw in last to last cross
krishna tells to me but although i'm equally disposed to everyone but i'm especially inclined
i favor my devotees because krishna is especially inclined towards his devotees he gives the
devotees guidance from within the heart internally externally he is always helping the devotees
that despite all disqualification so never please think oh prabhu i am very much addicted i am highly
i am a chain smoker i smoke every day or i'm a drunkard or i take even drugs or mariona or
something i cannot leave i have so much habit of illicit sex i have some other desires i cannot
leave it does not matter simply please take complete shelter of krishna there have been
examples of people who are completely lost when prabhupada went to the west so there were
civilizations of nude people they would not wear any clothes on their bodies
and those people spoke in the assembly of those people and they got converted hippies hippies
means they would do all nonsense kinds of activities like animals always high on drugs
and those people became sannyasis and vaishnavas very very advanced people so from the time of
tetanus it is not a new process people have followed they have got success and now this
very nice opportunity is there so earlier it was restricted now everyone and even we have such
wonderful devices amazing technology is there prabhupada's vani is there all of us can listen
anytime and make very nice spiritual advancement so what is required is complete surrender unto
krishna god is telling somebody comes to me then forget everything how much addicted you are how
much less sense control you have whatever it is so never overestimate your disease and never
underestimate krishna consciousness so just like when i was in my college some 12 13 years ago i
think 13 years ago so i got jaundiced and then i had nice plans of you know doing some nice
internship somewhere and everything all collapsed two months i was having jaundice and then i have
to leave my work and then come back to home and then we were taking some medicines and i got to
neolopathy as no medicine for jaundice what to do and then some people recommended know this
there is a person here he give you some some pand leaf and put some spices something into it you
take that you'll get cured in three doses but i could not develop faith okay many doctors are
there i'll visit and i'll get cured that's what i thought but then nothing is happening
vacation is over next semester is going to start now what to do so i had to travel back to my
college so as a last hope i thought okay let me visit this person and for two two and a half months
i was having jaundice no signs of reduction and then i thought what will happen now three doses
i cannot take because next day i have to leave for college and just i took one dose and immediately
the same day entire jaundice vanished from the body so just see this is called ayurveda very
advanced science allopathy i visited best of the doctors in jaipur and other place where my college
was and other places also but nobody could give me any solution and they told it is swelling of
the liver and we have to wait just control something your diet and all but now ayurveda
has got a cure very nice cure and this person gave those things and once i ate and immediately
it is perfect although i had no hope in a similar fashion this krishna consciousness is extremely
far full process because lord is sitting in our heart and he personally removes all the impurities
rajas and tamas from the heart as soon as we engage in chanting and hearing his holy names
but under the guidance of a bona fide spiritual master that is very important so thus there is a
great hope for all of us and then krishna mentions
so when those people who are not having sufficient punya in their previous life they also can make
their life perfect then what to speak of brahmanas what to speak of rajarishis the saintly kings
and what to speak of bhakta what to speak of the devotees who are already engaged in the service of
krishna what to speak how much they can elevate themselves in spiritual life if they follow this
process because they are engaged in my service in this world which is krishna is telling
so there are two main philosophies of spiritual life one is called
impersonalism another is personalism so one class of people the devotees we tell the absolute truth
he is a personality he has hands legs he's a person we are his images here in this world
and another set of people spiritualists they tell god has got no form he's simply one light one
energy and then we ask them if there is simply light and energy then why we are seeing so many
forms if ultimately everything is formless then how so many forms have come into picture beautiful
forms beautiful actors actresses beautiful faces you see even ordinary person's face is so beautiful
and symmetrical so how this beauty is there in the world around us amazing flowers and all the
species and birds and fishes who has given this beauty so they tell actually this is all illusion
there are no forms existing in this world just like in dream you think oh i am seeing a tree i am
touching a tree i am seeing water i am walking on road you are experiencing but actually that is
illusion there are no forms over there so they tell actually you are not existing in the world
the world is existing in your mind in your brain just like in dream you think you are existing in
some world but that is not reality as soon as you wake up entire world of dream finishes similarly
the advaitavadis they tell that actually this world is illusion this world does not exist you
don't exist in this world you are living in some planet in some country this is all illusion this
is because you are dreaming now so as soon as you follow the spiritual life one day when you become
self-realized when you are awakened from this dreamy situation then whole world will stop to
exist all the forms will stop to exist you will not see any form however this verse it rejects such
philosophy so krishna the supreme personality they also take bhagavad gita as bona fide scripture
but because they have not taken it from a perfect guru they get confused in their life
so here krishna is telling sir this word is anityam asukham lokam so this word is anityam
anityam means temporary krishna is not telling it is illusion krishna is telling it is temporary
anityam very clear so all such philosophies where people tell god is an energy and this world is
also simply energy forms are illusory krishna rejects that philosophy immediately although
krishna is rejected sufficiently in the second chapter which we will cover some times later
but now we can see anityam krishna is mentioning this world is temporary it is not illusory
and this world is asukham there is classification brahmana and raj rishi raja kshatriya there is
vaishya shudra somebody will be in a good position bad position but in whichever position you are
you can be living in a very nice apartment in mumbai or you could be living in a village or
in a slum or somewhere else but who is happy we think oh slum person thinks if i go to chawl
i'll be happy a person who is living in chawl he thinks if i go to that apartment i'll be happy
he thinks if i go to new york i'll be happy i'll be very very happy and then they are thinking if
i go to mars i'll be very happy but krishna tells asukham lokam it is very very nice you can read
here god himself has labeled this world is asukham and then again krishna repeats in bhagavad gita
dukh alayam the house of misery so when krishna himself has labeled that this world is dukh alayam
full of miseries it is asukham then why we are working hard to become happy in this life
so we should leave all the endeavors to become happy in this life because krishna has made this
world miserable nobody can be happy in this material world this knowledge people do not have
every person has a hope oh one day i'll be happy just like the carrot dangling in front of an ass
person is sitting on top of an ass and he's dangling one carrot and as is thinking if i
little closer i'll get the carrot he dies but never gets the carrot in a similar fashion we
are thinking happy happy two more years three more years and then i will be happy the person
becomes old he is dying but there is no happiness in life so thus we should read bhagavad gita
krishna tells asukham lokam as long as we are living here in this material world there is no
question of happiness but there is one possibility of happiness when we transfer ourselves to
spiritual world or we transfer ourselves to spiritual consciousness then there is happiness
as soon as a person becomes completely surcharged in contact with krishna he is no longer in this
material world although he appears to be living here for devotee vishvampoornam sukhayate in any
situation he is like his life is full of happiness the shastras give the example oh how it can be
full of happiness so very nice example is there devotee is also dying devotee is also getting
corona affected the devotee is also getting diseased so devotee's life is also miserable
if a devotee never falls sick if i see devotee is not dying he is always young healthy
hale and hearty then i will chant hari krishna prabhu but why should i chant we see devotee also
died immediately when the corona started in the world devotee is also falling sick why all these
things are happening so example given is just like the rat is in the jaws of kitten or a cat
then the rat is so much full of fear that i am killed now he's experiencing death and pain
but the same cat is also holding its kids in its jaws and they are feeling completely
protected oh i am in the jaws of my mother now nobody can give me any harm so all the both are
held in the jaws of the mother cat the cat the kitten is feeling bliss complete happiness and
protected and the rat is feeling death although apparently the behavior is same in a similar
fashion when the devotee is met with similar circumstances devotee is in complete bliss
because he understands everything is happening as per the plan of krishna krishna has taken charge
of my life krishna is my father so everything is for my good everything is for my benefit
so there is a very nice story in this connection one devotee shared with me today so shila pravapada
spiritual master bhakti siddhanta maharaj it is during his time that a brahmachari he got very
sick and he got to know that in few months he's going to die leave his body and when the news
started spreading that he's going to die and then he had some last desire also and his last desire
was that i wish to see my mother he had never gone home he had joined the temple and brahmacharis
usually they don't go home he was living there only and now that i'm going to die for all these
years i have not contacted my family it was no zoom and calls and phones at that time it is
pre-independent sara we are talking of so let me go and see my mother now that i'm going to die
harry krishna harry krishna okay yeah so this brahmachari was about to die and then finally
the time was very less and then they got to know in next two to three days the person is going to
die the devotee is going to die and then bhakti siddhanta maharaj he told that now you can visit
your house you can see your mother and the devotee told no i don't want to leave i am going to die
in two to three days any moment i can die i want to die navadvibham navadvibham is the place where
took birth just like krishna took birth in vrindavan the vrindavan is worshipable spiritual
world similarly navadvibh where chaitanya mahaprabhu appeared that is also non-different from vrindavan
and if a person leaves his body in dham then he goes back to godhead so he told no now i'm going
to die soon anytime i would have visited my mother and come back now there is no hope so i want to
die here so that at least my life is successful i don't want to go home so he told no i expel you
from the ashram i order you you leave and go home and thus with the help of some people he was
told to leave the ashram and depart for for home and then he started his journey and he was just
on the midway that he became very very ill and he left his body so neither he could see his mother
nor he could die in navadiv dham he left dham also he could not visit at house house also
so the other god brothers who were there with the brahmachari so they could not understand the
behavior of a spiritual master that what kind of spiritual master the behavior he has shown
brahmachari never asked anything he has done this seva he wanted to go home he did not allow
and now when he should not have left the dham he was about to die anytime he forced him out of dham
and he has left his body outside dham what birth he is going to get next life
so this confusion was there how guru maharaj can be so ruthless and this thing some doubts may
happen may come at times so then he consulted bhaktistan maharaj he told actually had i sent
the brahmachari earlier and he would have visited the mother then all those things there is a chance
meeting mother after a very long time he has not seen he's weak when the body is weak body is
diseased mind and senses also become very weak he can have some emotions or at least he'll be
thinking of his mother at the faggot fag end of his life and then thinking of his mother if he
leaves his body in those material attachments that may not be that is not a very good way to
leave the body the purpose of this life is to think of krishna when you are leaving the body
that is success of human life so why you did not allow him to die now in the ashram then
so he told now had i told him to remain here only he was always actually when he was here he could
understand the mindset of his disciple he was thinking about his mother because i'm not allowed
to go but now that he's so sick i've told him forced him to go to house when he left now he
was very anxious that i'm going to die and he was thinking about the dham always so although his
body was out of dham but his mind was completely absorbed in the dham so actually we are where our
mind is so because his mind was completely absorbed in the thought of dham actually he
left his body in that sense in dham so he became successful so this is success of life so thus
spiritual master knows exactly and very perfectly how to guide a disciple towards
perfection of spiritual life he can have some attachments he can develop some material desires
like this brahmachari developed at the end of his life but if a person is under the shelter of
spiritual master then his life is successful then the mantra will be effective then his life is
successful and without spiritual master the mantra will not be having any effect you read
entire bhagavad gita it will not be having any effect so the bhagavad gita that we will understand
the lectures that we will understand our understanding directly depends upon our
relationship with the spiritual master so there's the most important essence of spiritual life
so how do we associate with our spiritual master shila pravopada we don't see shila pravopada around
us how do we take guidance from him how he will correct my mistakes this is also very important
question bhakti's dana maharaj was there to guide the disciple and took this proper decision
but how pravopada is there aware i don't seem he has left his physical body in 1977 so where is
my spiritual life should i search another person who is having a physical body who can guide me
or what is the right way about it so this is what we'll understand tomorrow
