So Lord Krishna we saw in the previous verse, in this chapter has completely decimated the impersonal concept. Lord Krishna told what is the purpose of all the Vedic knowledge? It is to understand that this material world is reflection, perverted reflection of spiritual reality. And if a person is very, very learned in the vedas, he's doing duties also very nicely, but he has not got the result. The understanding that this material world is a perverted reflection, this is not the place where we belong to. It is an uncomfortable situation for the conditioned soul. And thus he develops strong detachment. With the weapon of detachment one should cut down this tree. This is the instruction of Lord Krishna. So a person who understands this thing that I have to cut down my material existence with asanga shastrayana with the weapon of detachment he has understood vedas any person who engages in loving service of Krishna vasude bhagavati bhakti yoga prayogita Janayati ashu VA gamashu means very soon. It is not an easy process to develop detachment. But when a person engages in devotional service, as we saw in the previous session, how to develop detachment, then very easily ashu means very soon varagyam renunciation comes in the heart and gyanam Chayad ahetukam knowledge. Spiritual knowledge is also automatically revealed. There is no need to speculate and put so much of reasoning simply by following the devotional service of Krishna, all the knowledge is automatically revealed along with renunciation. So thus, because Lord Krishna is stressing upon pure Bhakti yoga in Bhagavad gita, there is no need to mention the Vedic rituals which gradually bring person to this platform. So this is very important. Of all the spiritual knowledge which we are cultivating, this is the first result asang shastrina to empower oneself with the weapon of detachment. So if a person is not able to have this weapon of detachment, then whatever duties we are doing lord Kapila tells in Srimad Bhagavatam neha yat karma Dharmaya if a person is doing his karmas very nicely, karma should lead one to Dharma a religious life neha yat karma Dharmaya NA Viragaya kalpate. And the religious duty should lead a person to Viragaya kalpate renunciation. But if it does not happen in that way, then jeevan API MRHA then a person, even though he is living, should be considered dead. Jeevan API MRHA a dead man does not make any movement. So if a person is doing the duties very nicely and reading the scriptures nicely, following whatever spiritual process nicely, but naviragai kalpate it does not lead one to viragi renunciation then jivanapimritoisa all those duties and endeavors for knowledge, for spiritual life, for religious life, they are waste of time and a person should not stop there. This is the first thing arming oneself with the weapon of detachment, then he should cut down the material existence and then Lord Krishna tells after that what you should do. Tato padam tat parimar gitavyam yasmin gatayo if a person goes to that place nanivartanti Bhuyaha you should find a place reaching where nobody needs to come back again. To this material world one is not incarnated again. So that place is some energy that also Lord Krishna described very nicely. No, that is not simply energy because this tree is reflection of material world. So if you reach that place, chadhyam purusham prapadhya tam ewa chadyam if you go to that place, you will find adyam purush adi purush the original personality. And what is the nature of this personality? This person was there existing from the beginning and he was the result of some chemical combination. No. It is explained by Lord Krishna. Everything in this material world pravritani, it has been expanding, it is sustaining abiding in this supreme person. So this supreme person is the origin of all the life that we see around us, all the matter that we see around us. And it is not the result of evolution from some dead energy or chemicals. So this is very clearly explained by Lord Krishna. So reaching that place from where nobody has to take birth again in this material world, there you will find supreme personality and prapade. Prapadhya means one must surrender. So one's entire spiritual life, it depends upon surrender. It is from here that the real spiritual life begins. So the purpose of Bhagavad Gita is to bring a person to this point of surrender. Here. Lord Krishna ends the instructions. Sarvagamam Bhuya shrino Mehamam Bachahasana. This is 14th chapter. Lord Krishna has stressed surrender. And after finishing the instructions in next two chapters again in the concluding Summarizing 18 chapter, lord Krishna tells now understand the most secret of all the instructions. Sarvadharman Parityajya forget all the other Dharmas that you have created and Ma'am akam only unto Me you surrender completely. And then how to execute spiritual life? That is mentioned in Srimad Bhagavatam. So Bhagavad Gita is to elevate a person to the spiritual platform and unless one surrenders, then there is no question of spiritual life. Just like if we don't surrender to doctor, we don't surrender to the school system. There is no question of education, we don't surrender to doctor. There is no question of curing one's disease. In a similar fashion, in order to cure the material disease, one has to surrender to Krishna so that Krishna can take charge or to his representative spiritual master. So Krishna does not interfere with the free will of the living entity that Krishna has given us and that will be there eternally with us. The free will we want, we can use it for Krishna or against Krishna. We can use it for our benefit or our loss. That freedom Krishna has given, he will give always good counsel. But whether we take it or not, Krishna gives the freedom to us. But Krishna gives the good counsel that please surrender unto Me. I am the most wise person, I am your best well wisher. Suryam Sarvabh, Bhutanam. Do not think that I am thinking of my own profit. I need not have any profit. Everything belongs to me. So whatever I'm instructions the instructions I am giving to you, they are for your benefit. I am your best well wisher. So attaining the platform of liberation one should be able to surrender unto the supreme Personality of Godhead tam, Ava, Adyam, Purusham, Prapadhya and whether one receives spiritual bliss or spiritual knowledge. Cessation of all the material miseries empowerment in preaching everything depends upon surrender. So one should decide now I should not do any more calculations. Surrender completely. Follow each and every instruction of Lord Krishna without any exception. That is called surrender. Without caring for one's profit or loss or anybody's profit or loss. Of course when we surrender to Krishna we are not at loss. Nobody is at loss. Somebody may ask so what happened to the devotee? We are discussing about Draupadi. Draupadi surrendered to Krishna. An unlimited sari was supplied and Prahlad Maharaj surrendered to Krishna. He was saved in all circumstances. But no, there are other examples also there was Jatayu, he was also surrendered. And so many devotees are there. So why Krishna did not save the devotees? Why such bad incidents do keep happening to the devotees? It's not the first time it has happened. In the movement itself it has happened. Devotees have surrendered. They have dedicated their life to Krishna. And Krishna does not protect. It has been happening from always. When the Muslims they had invaded they were killing people. Even Christians were killing and so many invaders they were killing. But why Krishna did not protect his devotees? So Krishna always protects his devotees. Protection is spiritual. Whether the body is kept or destroyed, that is not important. So devotees not at all at loss. At the loss of body. That is what Lord Krishna explained to Arjuna also do not care for preservation of this material body. The body anyway has to go. But if the body is spent for Krishna then the life is glorious. Such a devotee is very very fortunate. Who is able to sacrifice his life for Krishna. Because he is able to attract the mercy of Krishna immediately. Anyway death will happen. Pain will happen. And there is immense pain at the time of death. Without pain no soul is going to leave the body. We are so much attached to this filthy material body. Because of illusion we don't want to leave. So there is enormous pain. And only then the soul leaves the body. So the pain has to come. Death has to come. We cannot continue forever. But if we leave this dress, this body in the service of Krishna take pain in the service of Krishna then life becomes glorious. Krishna told Arjuna, why you are worrying? Bhishma are there, Drona are there. They are very dear to you. Your other relatives are there. But why do you think that they are at loss. They are anyway in old bodies and their lives have been virtuous. So if the virtuous person dies on the battlefield now anyway they are having old bodies. Either they will be liberated if they have been perfectly virtuous or because they have been pious in this life they will have a very good birth in the next life. So there is no loss at all. Why you want them to continue in this miserable body and not do your duty at the same time. So you continue with your duty. And if they are perfect they will be liberated. Even if they are not liberated because they are very very pious their next birth is going to be extraordinary. So this is called Krishna's protection. So one should not at all think protection means in terms of the body that also if you want Krishna will do it. So there is one case where one devotee was there and this devotee was there doing book distribution. So many devotees were doing book distribution and they were being harassed by a bike gang. And they were having America and even unemployed person get so much of money. So people, the youngsters were on drugs and all these activities they would do and they would harass the devotees. They would chase the devotees. They would create so much of trouble. So once it so happened that these people, these bikers, they again came and all the other devotees, they left the spots. Otherwise they would create disturbance. But they were able to corner this one devotee and he was not able to escape. Then he tried to run and save himself. So that day they appeared to be very angry and it seemed they are going to beat the devotee. So they kept on chasing me. They did not leave and so many bikers were there and the devotees was not knowing what to do, kept on running. And ultimately there was no way to go and there was a dead end. So at the dead end now devotee finding himself hopeless. Now all these people are going to beat him very badly. He does not know what is going to happen. And such cases had happened before also they were being beaten in the airport and so many other places. So these people, they stopped behind the devotee and the devotee was very fearful. Now I think I'm going to be beaten up very badly. So, as Prabhupada instructed, Lord Narsim Dev. This is a special incarnation of Krishna which is meant for giving protection to the devotees. So Lord takes different forms in different moods. So when there is a question of giving protection to devotees he appears in the form of nursing Dev. So Lord nursing devotees always pray to him whenever such physical protection is required. And the devotee immediately closed his eyes and with great attention, with surrender he started praying to Narsim Dev namaste Narsim Maya Prahala Daladha Dain. He started chanting the prayers. And there are two versions of this real history historical incident that has happened. So some devotees tell that devotee look back and after finishing the prayers and he sees that they are gone and he's not able to understand where they have gone. And in another version they tell the devotees started hearing the screams and they were screaming and shouting and they were dropping their bikes and they themselves were falling down on the street. And when he turned around, he wanted to move towards them. They ran away in fear. So he was not able to understand what has transpired. Then it so happened that after a couple of days these bikers, they meet the devotee and they are very fearful, they are very scared. So he was able to speak to one of them and he asked what happened that day? You were almost upon me, you could do anything with me. But why you suddenly ran away? All of you vanished. So then he told no, please do not do that with us again. So it was very horrible. That tiger which you created, so devotees, what tiger? So he told, no, when you did something over there in the wall then a very ferocious tiger appeared on top of you. And the tiger was about to eat all of us and we were very scared for our lives. So we ran from that place. So this is a real thing which has happened. And like this many many pastimes are there of the devotees. Many many pastimes of Lord Nar Singh they are protecting so simply if a devotee surrenders to Krishna then Krishna gives him all protection. If you want that Krishna, please protect me physically. Then Krishna will protect physically also the devotees. But devotees, unless there is a specific mission in which physical protection is required, they don't ask for it. Unless Krishna has given spiritual master has given the order, you go and execute this task. Then the devotee may ask for protection of Krishna. That task is not yet completed. I have to finish this. If you so desire please protect me. Otherwise devotees just pray to Krishna. Krishna Rake, Mareke, krishna Mare, Rakheke Marobi, Rakobi, Joik, Chatur whether you want to keep me alive or you want to kill me, whatever you want, you please do me. Sometimes Krishna may kill like Parishit Maharaj. Parishit Maharaj was such a pure devotee of Krishna that he was meditating upon Lord Krishna right from the womb of the mother. In the womb of the mother he was able to see krishna's body was destroyed by Brahmastra and another body was given within the womb. Usually when the body is destroyed, the soul has to go to another body. But parishit Maharaj, being anithya Siddha devotee came with a special purpose here. And thus Lord Krishna made this special arrangement. Even though his body was burned by the Brahmastra, lord Krishna gave another body immediately and he saw Supreme Personality within the womb. And thus he was always meditating upon that personality. And when parishit Maharaj came out, he was always doing Pariksha. He was always trying to examine oh, who is that person I saw in the womb? Where can I find that person I saw in the womb? That is why he was called Parikshit. He was always trying to figure out where is that who is that person who I saw in the womb? So parishit Mahara, such a great devotee of Krishna who never thought anything, who never did anything other than service of Krishna such a pure devotee was cursed to die in seven days. Now 1 may wonder what is this? What to speak of giving protection krishna has arranged for the devotee to die similarly. Bishma pitam. What is Bishma's fate? Bishma is also a pure devotee of Krishna, one of the Mahajan. It is told if you have to follow and understand the science of absolute truth, you have to follow twelve authorities. The greatest authorities spiritual knowledge should be taken either from these twelve authorities or from the devotees who are representative of these authorities who are simply repeating the instructions. These people are best in the knowledge. Swayambu Narada Shambhu Kamaram Kapilo Manu in six Kanto third chapter, verse number 22, it is mentioned these are the authorities. Swayambhu means lord brahma Narad muni shambhu lord Shiva lord brahma Narad muni lord Shiva Kamaram Kapilo manu so these twelve authorities are the greatest and Bhishma is one among them. Prahalado Januko Bhishma Balir Vayasiki Vayam so Bhishma being such a stalwart devotee of Krishna, krishna gave this destiny that you have to lie on the bed of Pharaohs. Because Krishna understands that devotees are beyond these conceptions of happiness and distress as we have discussed in the previous session. Also so called labor, so called pain. We discussed three cases which these people experience. Actually it gives them very extraordinary kind of happiness. So thus the devotee is beyond the conception of physical protection or destruction. So that is why devotee has no desire unless it is for the service of Krishna. Then devotee, prays whatever is your desire, you please do. The five pandavas. Kunti Marani. They are eternal associates of Lord Krishna. In this material world, wherever Lord Krishna appears, the devotees also appear and they die. So what is this? They are eternal associates of Krishna. Krishna is subjecting them to repeated birth and death. Yes, birth and death does not affect them. This is the position of a devotee. So thus we should never try to measure Krishna's mercy by seeing the response of Krishna. In protecting this dress, Krishna wants to quickly call his devotees. And what to speak of his devotees? Even his own family members. The Yadu dynasty. Krishna had a huge dynasty. 16,108 wives from every wife he had got ten children. And all those children also had ten children. In this way Krishna's family was huge. Crores of family members were there. So this is called God. He was able to maintain so many family members. Now these people being son of God, as powerful as God nobody was able to destroy them. So now how to bring them back to Godhead? So thus Krishna devised a plan and the Yadu dynasty fought with each other and killed each other. So thus Krishna made his own family members kill each other. So for us ordinary people death is a very big thing. But for a devotee death is glorious in the service of Krishna. Rather aspired for devotees like a warrior whose desire is if I can sacrifice my life, my energy in the service of Krishna then my life would be successful. And as we have seen in the initial chapters of Bhagavad Gita this is the first instruction given to Arjuna. Arjuna was worried about death. So Krishna told this is a symptom of a liberated person, a wise person Arya. He never worries about Gata Suna, Gata Sushan Nanushanti Pandita and never laments about anything living or dead. It is like changing of dress. And a sober person is not bewildered by such a change. So devotee is not at all bewildered by such a change. It is simply changing of dress. So in every situation devotee must remain surrendered unto Krishna. Now whatever is good for devotee, Krishna will do that. Krishna is very eager to call the devotee immediately back to Godhead. Then this pastime of death can happen. If there is some task of Krishna then the devotee may continue to live for a long time. Lakshk Devoswami is living, Vedavyas is living and such great Parashuram is living. Such great personalities are even now living for a very very long time. Because they have specific task of Krishna to be fulfilled. So this surrender is the first word of spiritual life. In proportion to our surrender, spiritual knowledge is revealed. Surrender means complete surrender. There should be no doubt. Let me have my independence know as per the instructions of Krishna and spiritual master I'm going to do from there past karma does not act upon us and then our liberation is guaranteed. The more we surrender the more spiritual knowledge, spiritual pleasure is revealed. Spiritual potency comes to us the more we are able to preach this message across the world. But how to attain this surrender is very important question. So that Lord Krishna that process is being described here. So this is verse number five. Nirmanamoha jitasanga dosha adhyatmanitya vinivrita Kamaha dwanvayamukta sukaduka sangh gachantiyamura padam Avyayamta. One who is free from illusion, false prestige and false association who understands the eternal who is done with material lust and is freed from the duality of happiness and distress and who knows how to surrender unto the supreme person attains to that eternal kingdom. Now Krishna has defined the eternal kingdom where you find the supreme person to whom you have to surrender. So who attains that avyayami's eternal position. Any situation in this material world is temporary. We become very famous, very strong, very wise it will be lost. So in order to attain the eternal situation one must surrender to Krishna. Surrender is the cost of the ticket to go back to Godhead. So who will be able to surrender? What is the process? So first of all a person should be free from false prestige Srila Prabhupada explains the first qualification is that one should not be deluded by pride. Pride is a great delusion because the conditioned soul is puffed up thinking himself the Lord of material nature it is very difficult for him to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One should know by the cultivation of real knowledge that he is not the Lord of material nature. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the Lord. When one is free from delusion caused by pride he can begin the process of surrender. For one who is always expecting some honor in this material world it is not possible to surrender to the supreme person. So that is why we keep on hearing this foremost instruction. The first instruction Lord Krishna is telling always follow this instruction of being very humble. This is the first step. Lord Jesus told the same thing the Kingdom of God is meant for meek and humble. So one has to learn humility, pridelessness, not expecting any honor for oneself and offering all honor, all respect to others. Man they are offering all respect to others and not expecting any honor for oneself. If we are expecting any honor in this material world it is not possible to surrender unto Krishna and that is what we are trained to do. So just see, that is why Bhaktivinod Thakur tells Jadavidya Yatamara Maya Rabha this materialistic education is Vaibha is opulence of illusory energy of Krishna Maya Durga Devi so if a person is educated in this system then the person goes away from Krishna and makes the life more complicated. So here everybody's taught oh you, please go to school and study very nicely so that you can make us feel proud. People want to have pride in their achievements, in their possessions and we are taught you compete from the very beginning of life, earn more marks and earn more money and earn a very handsome or beautiful or rich spouse and then show off to others. And this was Zarjuna's reason also one of the reason he told my what is the use of winning this kingdom, Keshava? Because all my relatives will be killed. A person wants to have a kingdom so that he can show it off to relatives if you are the only person on the planet, shall we like to crack any examination or have a very big house or big car or big position or success? No. All this is because we want that taste of pride. We are expecting some honor in this world that is why people are working very hard. They want honor. I want promotion, I want marks, I want money, I want profile, I want to show, I want status in society. What will happen if I don't work nicely? What will people think of me? What will my boss think of me? What will my spouse think of me? Family members think of me? And thus they work very, very hard because we are expecting some honor in the society, in the family or wherever. And this is a great deception. Lord Krishna is over and over again repeating this thing that in a temporary situation why you want to feel this false pride and which anyway is not because of you, your possessions, it is because of the things which I have given to you. If two people are told to cut woods, one person is having very nice automatic axe, one person is having old mechanical hand axe, other person would be more efficient. It is because of the machine he has got. So some people have intelligent machines, handsome machines, very strong machines, and they become proud. I am knowledgeable, I am strong, I am handsome, I'm beautiful. So this pride is because of the instrument. Why should you be proud of this? So only foolish people, they want to have honor in a temporary situation for something which does not belong to them. And as long as they keep on hankering after this pride, after this honor, it is not possible to surrender. It is a great delusion expecting honor and we all want that. And thus all this hard work which we are doing. So people ask prabhu, why is life so complicated? Five days, so much we have to work hard weekend I cannot come for classes, I have to just sleep and do some household works. So they know their life is not good. They are completely stressed out and messed up. It is becoming more and more complex. But simply because of this having honor, people are not nirmana moha, they are not free from expecting honor. So that is a humility. I do not want any honor in this world. This is very important. And honor from whom I am expecting mad people who do not even know they are not this body, they are all thinking I am this body. So who expects any respect from the mad people? Only another mad person can do that. And a mad person cannot understand truth, absolute truth, Krishna. And there is no question of surrender without surrender, there is no question of freedom from sinful reactions without which a person is always troubled in mind and body. So nirma moha, one has to become free from this tendency of seeking honor. This is very, very important. We should try to come to this platform now. I do not want now if you are not able to decide, okay, after this much time I do not want any honor. I will not do any activity to gain any honor in this world. And why this tendency comes in the heart. Why do we want honor? It is because of Moha. It is because of illusion. We think I am this body, I am the owner of this body. So I take pride in the body and bodily relationships and possessions. It is because of illusion of bodily concept of life. So that is why this illusion from the heart is cleansed. By chanting this Hare Krishna Mahamantra. This is the medicine. So when we chant Hare Krishna Mahamantra, we should chant offenselessly. When I'm chanting, suppose Radha and Krishna come to my place. I will make them seated very nicely, respectfully, and I will request individually Radharani. My dear Krishna, please remove this illusion from my heart. I am suffering here in this material world. Please place me as a particle of dust on your lotus feet. In this way, individually we request the Holy Name incarnation of Radhakrishna also Hare. Please save me Krishna, please save me. That is what Chaitanya Mahaprabhu told Patithambam vishame bhavam Buddha. Somehow I've fallen into this material world. So please take me out of this illusion on my own. I cannot do this. So in this way chanting has to be done. Not fast, not to finish. This is an offense. And if we are not careful about avoiding the offenses, it will lead to material desires in the heart and will choke up whatever chanting we are doing. So even though we are not able to chant offense swiftly, we should consistently try to avoid the offenses. Not try to slur or try to chant fast and try to act as a matter of formality. That is an offense. We are telling Krishna come in quickly, go, come one or eight times and then you go away quickly. Because I've decided one or eight times I will offer you something. So we should very respectfully receive each and every Holy Name nicely. And then speed will increase automatically. And then if with such careful attention, simply careful attention, respect, if we offer to the Holy Name and with regularity we chant automatically, we will develop taste in the Holy Name and such offenseless chanting is powerful and then this illusion is destroyed automatically. We'll be able to understand the spiritual concepts. I am not this body. I'm here for a short while. Why I'm taking so much of complications in my life. So when I am free from illusion, then I can expect to come to the platform of Nirmana. Not expecting any honor in this world. So it all begins with chanting the Holy Names of Krishna. So please take this process very very sincerely. Prabhupada hear each and every word very nicely and mind should get logged in the sound vibration. We should be able to chant in such a way. And when the mind is locked in the sound vibration, we are chanting very very attentively. This should be our endeavor. God helps those who help themselves simply intense eagerness or. Desire to have it is the cost of material or spiritual attainments whatever we have here. So if we are very eager yes I want to have this. Spiritual master is ordered. You should lock your attention. You should be able to chant offenselessly. So I pray to Krishna when I'm very eager to do it Krishna will help me to do it. And on my side I should take all the proper measures which are required. Sleep early, sleep regularly sufficiently get up in the brahmorta, take cold water bath do not commit sinful activities. Do not break four regulative principles do austerity and this way we'll be able to lock our attention chant without disturbance. So nirma namoha so then if we are able to chant in this way minimizing our offenses in that proportion the illusion will go from the heart. Then we will lose this tendency of seeking. It will be very clear. Mad people I am also mad. What is the question of expecting any honor working hard to get any honor in this world and then when this happens then person will be able to have jittasanga dosha. Now in this illusion we create false associations. Association of family, society or nation. We think I belong to this family and this is not my family. We belong to this nation that is enemy nation. I belong to human society, animal society save humans and kill animals. This is foolishness it is just like two people are there on the stage one is wearing the dress of human, another is wearing the dress of animal. And you kill the person who is wearing dress of animal and eat that person thinking you have done very nice and distribute that meat equally among the other people who are wearing the dress of humans. So people praise various such a nice man so many people he has given employment to and very sober person very humble down to earth the only thing is heat meat. If somebody is eating meat where is a question of any sanity or intelligence? This basic sense is not there that simply my brother in different dress I have killed him. So that is why so called goodness or badness it is all badness, all illusion in this world as long as person is in bodily concept of life so person creates such false associations he will protect his family and then he will compete with other families at best or harm other families at the worst. He will fight for his nation and harm other nations. In next life he may take birth in the very same nation he has killed those nationals in the previous birth. So in this way illusion happens. I protect humans I kill animals or I protect animals I kill myself so there are some NGOs which are working very hard for animal protection that is very nice but that is another phase of ignorance they are better than other people who are killing. But what do they do? They save animals? I need not kill animal but actually they are killing animal in that sense. So I was speaking to one of the devotees. He told Prabhu I'm going to get married. I will not sit upon the horse. So sitting on horse or not is not important. Anyway that is not compulsion for marriage. But the principle is they don't want to use animals for services. Now this is greatest of the ignorance that we can have and it is greatest harm to the animal. So people who are not very wise or species who are not wise and intelligent their only hope of deliverance is if intelligent human beings engaged in service of God engage them in their service then they also become servants of God. They are also delivered. So just like we were discussing the other day that women have very strong material desires it is difficult to advance. So women should play an assistant role to the husband. And if the husband advances very nicely then women can make automatically advancement. They can go to the destination. So those people who have more material contamination especially the animals which are highly contaminated by tamuguna there is no hope of understanding absolute truth. If the animals are used by a person who is engaged in service of Krishna you take the milk of cow and offer to Krishna. Cow would be delivered. You take the plant from tree offered to Krishna. Plant would be delivered. If you use ox or bull to produce food which is used to offer to Krishna then bull would be delivered. You use them to carry Krishna or carry devotees for their work then they would be delivered. The donkey is being used as is being used to carry the clothes of devotee for washing. Donkey would be delivered. So they would be delivered simply by serving the devotees very nicely. So this is devotional concept how they are harming those animals. They could have taken immediately human form by doing the save or in some cases might have gone back to Goddess also directly. But they are denying this opportunity to them or even considering from the material point of view if you do not engage animals in these works then the only option left for the animals is they have to be killed. This is what materialist will think. Who doesn't have this higher sense, he will think just like in some countries camels are more and there is no use. We have now cars with us. We need not travel on camels. So let us kill those chemicals. So they assemble all the camels together. They shoot all the camels. In some countries they assemble all the elephants together. Now we have tanks and other things. We need not have elephants for our military and our other use then let us kill the elephants. So in this way if animals are not put to proper use you will have industry and have a wrong substitute for these animals. You will kill yourself from the industry, planet from the industry. And you will kill animals also because they have no use. Now you want to bring them on equal platform, animal equality or something. That is very great illusion. So thus unless a person comes out of this bodily concept of life everything is illusion. So called good work will also be the cause of harm to other person. That is why the person also meets death. Liberation is not given to any so called good worker. Because whatever good work the person is doing that is harming the other person in the long term. So thus these scientific, logical and simple concepts person is not able to understand in the bodily concept of life. So thus it is told one person should rise above such associations. So, first of all, Chaito dharpana Marjanam should happen. It begins from there. Person should be free from illusion of bodily concept. Then he or she will not desire. He or she will not think only about gender. We will understand we are not this body. And then we will be free from these false associations. We will understand. I am not a human being. I don't belong to some Samaj. Brahman Samaj, Agarwal Samaj, muslim Samaj, krishna Samaj. I don't belong to any Samaj. I don't belong to any society. I don't belong to any family. I don't belong to any nation. These are just dresses we have got here. External designations we have got here. So one has to be completely freed from any such associations. And very simple way of doing it is living in the association of devotees. We want some association. So if you live with devotees, identify ourselves with the devotees, a person automatically can avoid Sangha Dosha. So this association of materialist is a great fault. A person should be able to come out of this association and live only in the association of devotees. But unless a person identifies oh, I am Indian, I would like to live with India. Oh, I am Pakistani, I want to live with Pakistanis only. I am Muslim, I want to live with Muslims, I am this thing animal, I want to live with animals. This would be the natural tendency. They would always seek association. Similar association. So a person can avoid association of materialist only when is out of this bodily concept. And then he should live with the devotees. And then when a person is away from such false association. So Krishna consciousness has a very nice alternative. We can live in the association of devotees. Otherwise normally such people, they are not expecting any order in this world. So they leave immediately. Like parishit Maharaj, he left his riches, left everything, left his clothes. He is moving around in inner clothes. And he's not at all bothered what people will think about that. King is walking without any clothes and his spiritual master is also qualified. He's walking without any single cloth on his body. Hairs are disheveled. He is not bothered. People will think he's a madman. Naked man he's walking around like that. He's not at all bothered. Whatever people may tell, they may tell me and then they exchange spiritual discourses. Nirmana Moha but such thing cannot be executed in Kalyuga today. So we have very nice alternative. We can simply identify ourselves with the society of devotees. We can identify ourselves with the association of devotees. We want to have relationships. We have relationships with the devotees. And there is no need to have such a situation like sugar dev Goswami or Kapil Muni or Rishabh dev Go to the Himalayas avoiding all such association. If you live in association with devotee there is no question of associating with the materialist. But it is important avoiding this sangha dosha lord Krishna is mentioning here COVID patient gives you COVID. Similarly association of materialists gives us material disease. This illusory concept bodily concept of life niruman moha Jita Sangha Dosha and then when a person is away from this sangha dosha adhyat manitya then a person is expected to learn about spiritual life before there. There is is no question of spiritual life. At best a person can become religious fanatic. He is there on the material platform only although chanting the names of God. So in order to begin spiritual life a person has to be free from all these three steps moha Mana and Sangha dosha then a person should begin spiritual inquiry and Vinivrita Kama then when he advances in spiritual life he or she will be able to get free from all the lust of the heart. What is lust does not only mean as we have discussed desire for sexual enjoyment that is a grossest manifestation. Atmayindria Priti Vansha, Dhari Kamanam, Tarabali Kam any desire for one's own enjoyment it comes because of illusion. We think whatever I'm earning, I'm earning that belongs to me. I will enjoy the people around me. I will enjoy their service. But when a person understands everybody and everything belongs to Krishna how can I enjoy? Let me engage all these things and people in service of Krishna who are around me. So then that is called love and not lust. So then a person understands in spiritual life everything belongs to Krishna. He does not desire to enjoy anything in life. That is called Viniverita kama. So he does not just become free from any lusty desires in the heart but also he does not want to enjoy anything for his own pleasure. And then dwan Vayervimukta Sukh Duku Sanghya so there is something called sukh and something is called Duk. And the whole world is trying to increase happiness and mitigate distress. That is what we discussed we have been doing. And when a person follows this path of increasing happiness and reducing distress in Bhagavatam it is being mentioned prahlad Maharaj tells Sadha Apnotiyadukham that person attains only misery in life. So this is very important concept. Please understand. If we have spent any day working hard to become more happy and working hard to reduce distress of life we have simply increased our miseries of life. So when a person is able to surpass all these stages free from illusion, free from honor, free from sangha, free from karma lust then a person is able to come to a platform where he's free from the dualities of happiness and distress. Thus externally we may see or devotees are being put to so much of torture. Haridas Thakur eternally liberated devotee of Krishna is being tortured beaten in 25 markets. It is Krishna not having any heart. His devotees being beaten in 25 markets. Why lets his devotee undergo all these troubles? Why Bhishma is lying on the bed of Pharaohs? Why Jatai is dying? Why all these things are happening? No? So these are all external things. As we have discussed. Devotee is willing to take all the misery in the service of Krishna. This misery is like mother lifting the child on lap. The pain of the hands is not actually painful. It gives pleasure to the mother. It is like the load which the wife is having of the heavy husband while enjoying physical pleasures. That load is very much sought after. That load is like a businessman of that of having amassing huge wealth. That is a great load. But he takes pleasure in amassing that wealth. So these loads are desired by these personalities. So thus we should understand. We should rise above this external sukha and dukkha. It is very extraordinary platform as we can see from here. But all of us, it is mentioned can attain that platform. And we should aspire this is the only thing which has to be aspired for in this human form of life. I should be free from this illusion of sukha and dukha. Now also in this bodily concept of life Krishna consciousness is so nice. This liberated activity can be executed. So a devotee, even though he feels happiness and distress devotee decides I will not bother about my happiness and distress. So I will just try to serve Krishna. In service of Krishna, some sukha comes, I will accept it. In service of Krishna, some dukkha comes, I will accept that also. So even though he is experiencing some sukha and dukkha but his decisions are not getting affected by it. So in that sense he is also liberated. His course of action is not being affected by material sukha and dukha. So Krishna consciousness is so powerful. Even though the person is there on this material platform he can execute the personalities of liberated souls. So thus this is very very important. And when a person is able to follow this process gachantiyamura Padam Avayamtath then a person is able to surrender to Krishna and then he is able to go back to Godhead. So this is a process of surrender which begins from freedom from illusion not expecting any honor. Freedom from association of materialist false association and then cultivating spiritual life. Freedom from lust and freedom from these dualities of happiness and distress. We should stop planning to increase our happiness and reduce our stress. We should just plan every day how to give more pleasure to Krishna. And then we see pleasure automatically increases in our life from the very beginning. So of course this thing has to be executed under the guidance of devotees. But we have to understand it is great illusion this honor pride for which we are working. It is a great illusion and harassment for the conditioned soul. And life becomes very complicated because of the seeking honor. Because of this tendency of planning to increase happiness and mitigating distress we make our lives complicated. We should plan how to make Krishna happy under guidance of devotees. And then we'll be able to surrender to Krishna and go back to spiritual world. And what is the nature of that world? Krishna tells Natad bhasayat suryo nashashanko NA pavakah yad gatva nanivartante taddhama paramama my abode is bhasayate means that abode of mine is not illumined by the sun or moon nor by electricity. Pavakaha one who reaches it never returns to this material world. So here only one planet is effulgent sun. So Krishna is telling in spiritual world every planet is effulgent. So there is no need of any extra sun, moon or electricity. Because everything is effulgent like the sun of this material universe. And if a person goes there NA nivartante then he does not come back. And Taddhama dhama means my planet or my abode where I live. So that is my abode. I live in that place. Arjuna arjuna I don't belong to this material earth so I live in that place eternally. Tad dhama that is my abode and you should aim to come to that abode and live with me. So Srila Prabhupada mentions in this purport a person should get captivated by this information. I am trying to go to this country or that country because weather is good, protection is better. But what is protection and what is weather? We have to die here. But if you go to this place, there is no death. All the trees are desired trees. That is God's abode. Whatever you want, the tree will give you. All the cows are surubi cows. Whatever you desire edibles the cows can produce. The houses are made of touchstones which can turn iron into gold. And time does not move at all. You are not getting late at all for anything. Nimeshadhakyo, Vavrajiti, Nahiyatrabi, Samayah, Tata, Ghanam, natyam Gamanapi, Vanshi, Priyasaki every word is a song. There. Every gate is a dance there. That is called spiritual world of Krishna life full of bliss. So this is the place where God lives. And this is the message of Bhagavad gita please come home. Come back home back to Godhead. This is what Krishna is telling. So one should get captivated by this information and should take this as the ultimate aim of life. So this Impersonalism is a very neophyte understanding. Personal understanding of the spiritual reality is what Lord Krishna is stressing here. So let us try to follow this and surrender to Krishna as soon as possible. I have calculated so much in my life. Now let me follow completely Krishna. As I follow doctor, I follow my lawyer or my teacher or my coach. And then we'll be able to attain this process. So thank you so much for hearing. Now we'll be chanting Hare Krishna Mahamantra the beginning of this process of surrender which will take us out of this illusion. So this is very simple process. We have to chant Hare, Hare Krishna krishna Krishna hare Hare hare Ram hare Ram ram Ram Hare, Hare simply these words we have to chant and hear. And as I told, very respectfully addressing Hare and then Krishna individually requesting, please engage me in your service. Be very, very respectful in chanting. Be very attentive. Hear each and every word. Very nice.
