So in the second chapter of Bhagavad Gita which is the contents of the Gita summarized Lord Krishna mentioned yam imam pushpitam VA cham pravadanti avipashitah veda vadha ratha parta NA Anyad ASTI itivadinah some less intelligent people, they get carried away by the flowery injunctions of the vedas. So one of the symptoms of liberation which Lord Krishna mentioned in Buddhi Yoga in the second chapter is yada te Mohu kalilam Buddhir vyati tarishyati tadagantasi Nirvedam shota vyasyacha so niravedam going beyond the vedas. So repeatedly Krishna is telling go beyond the vedas, go beyond the vedas. One of the qualification of a person who is liberated is he doesn't get carried away by the flowery injunctions of the vedas. So mainly the vedas carry the Karmakanda portion. Which means you do this activity, you get material results. It is just like play school. As we have discussed, children are made to play initially for one or two years and gradually because they are just interested in playing, otherwise they cannot bear heavy burden of studies. So their inclination is to play. So they are made to play in the school and then gradually they are encouraged to work and study. So nobody is interested in going back to the eternal world. We are all attached to this temporary world. In madness we pursue our temporary material goals, temporary name, fame, happiness and keep on toiling and struggling and suffering unlimitedly. So in order to give us relief using our inclination to enjoy vedas, give us Karmakanda portion and a very small portion of the vedas upanishas. It gives us hint of spiritual life. That also. Only a hint of spiritual life is given. Only those people who are pure devotees, they can understand how these upanishas are pointing out to supreme Personality of Goddess. So it begins from there. So anybody who gets stuck, suppose a child is telling yes, I'm very regularly attending the classes. I'm going to school. For how many years? Ten years. Oh, you must be in this standard. Fifth standard 6th no, I'm still in play school. So then there is no use. He has not progressed. The intention of going to play school is not to keep you in the play school. In a similar fashion, the intention of Karmakanda portion. That is why vedivyas he criticized sorry Narad Muni criticized vedivyas jugup sitam. You have done abominable activity by explaining so many of these verses in the Karmakanda portion. You do this ritual, you do so many sanskaras and then you get married and then you have a house and do this ceremony. That ceremony. Do this charity, do this yajna sacrifice. And people will think I am very religious by following all these rules and regulations. And they will miss the purpose of these injunctions. And that is what people tell. No, we are very religious. We visit temple, we do yajna, we do sacrifice and we give a lot of charity also. So we are very religious people and people are satisfied in that way that they are following the Vedas. But actually that is a very great disaster in a person's life a person does not advance, he gets stuck at the basic level. So that is why Krishna told Pushpitam Vaacham ledas produce flowery words and that is fact also here in this world there is lot of trouble. You have to follow so many rules and regulations. And the greatest pleasure of this life which is the center of materialistic life yan Mathunadi, Grahamidi Sukhamitucham the physical pleasure, sexual pleasure it is very difficult. You cannot enjoy it much. Now some scientific inventions they have done to enjoy it. Otherwise child will come out. You cannot raise many child, many children. But in heavenly planets it does not happen like that. There they have a very very long life and you keep on enjoying. You will not produce any children. Only towards the end of their life they carry children. Otherwise you can keep on enjoying and you have a very long life. The diseases are very very less. The bodies are very nice here our bodies, they stink there the bodies produce fragrance. And here the bodies are very not appreciable in so many aspects. Beauty is not there, strength is not there but there the bodies are very useful. Very very beautiful. Many many times beautiful than the people of this planet. And the bodies are cold to touch in summers and they are warm in the winters. So thus there is unlimited opportunity for sense enjoyment. So like this Veda still description of this planet, that planet and so many things there is Siddhaloka, there is Gandharvaloka where you can fly with wings siddhaloka, you can fly without wings like Narad Muni and other sages are there. Here a person has to work very hard to gain some small mystic power on Siddhaloka everybody is born with ashta Siddhis. Can you just imagine people are so advanced, they are born with ashta Siddhis. They can become smaller than smallest, lighter than lightest, heavier than the heaviest. They can fly anywhere without any artificial planes or mechanical instruments like this there are descriptions of many many planets and various kinds of enjoyments. So people get carried away oh let me do this. That is why people follow. Now we are following Chatur Masya. So Chatur Masya these four months when it rains people are supposed to do rigorous austerity. And by this austerity we do it for advancement in spiritual life. But otherwise regularly people do it for elevation to higher planets. They get carried away by these injunctions. So Krishna is telling if you get carried away by these injunctions then you are lost. Avipashita vipashita means learned avipashita. Those people who are not learned Veda, Vada, Rathaparta they will quote so many of the Vedas but then NA Anyad ASTI itivadhina they tell this thing is all in order. There is nothing beyond this. You come here, you do some rituals, you have a religious life, moral life. As people tell what is the need of surrendering to Krishna and doing this chanting what you are doing? So yes, we are God fearing. We believe in God, we go to temple and we offer Him. We do charity and we are very moralist. We do our duty very nicely. So yes, if you follow all these regular injunctions so Avipashita, we are not very learned. Krishna is telling NA Anya ASTI itivadhinaha they tell, there is nothing beyond this. This is life. This is what you are telling Krishna. Krishna chanting, surrender, what is all this? So here in Bhagavad Gita but Krishna is telling the direct instruction to Arjuna. Arjuna was a strict follower of the Vedas. But despite following all the Vedic injunctions very very nicely, his problems of life were not solved. So unless we understand what is the purpose behind this section karmakanda and all the Vedas and unless we attain that purpose, problems of life will remain as it is, they will not be solved. Swarjuna knowing the Vedic culture following the Vedic culture adhering to it very very strictly was not satisfied. Thus Lord Krishna gave the ultimate instruction sarvadharman parityA JAMA may come sharonam raja manabha madhyaji mam Namaskuru as we saw in previous session also Bhakti is the only way by which you can understand. Mam chayo Vya bicharena bhakti Yogi NASA Sagunan Samtiti Brahma Bhuyaya kalpate bhakti Yoga Sava only a person who engages in unalloyed Bhakti yoga loving devotional service unto me he can surpass the effects of three energies and become completely free. So people may wonder bhakti Yoga, bhakti Yoga surrender to Krishna. What about all the injunctions? So many Vedas are there so many segments, so many duties, so many obligations. But where are all these things mentioned? There are so many duties and till the time of death a person has to do duty. But Bhagavad Gita is telling simply this thing most confidential instruction. Manmana Bhavad Bhakto, think of me, become my devotee, offer respects to me. Satam Kirtayantumam always chant my name simply this thing. Then what is the use of all such chandas? All such various segments? Aranikas Brahmanas so Lord Krishna tells very nicely in this 15 chapter what is the purpose of all these various Vedic injunctions? Big, big thick books having lacks of verses. And how? By understanding Bhagavad Gita, following the principles mentioned here, person surpasses all those regulations. So let us see chapter number 15 Purushotam Yoga or Yoga of the supreme person sri Bhagavanu VA Urdumula Madhashakam Ashwatam Prahur avyayam Chandansi asyaparnani Yastam Vedasavedavith the blessed Lord said there is a banyan tree which has its roots upwards and its branches down. And whose leaves are the Vedic hymns? One who knows this tree is the knower of the Vedas. Chodham Prashritashta Seshaka Guna Pravridha Vishaya Pravala adhashamu ANU Santatani Karmanubandhini manushaloke the branches of this tree extend downward and upward nourished by the three modes of material nature the twigs are the objects of the senses. This tree also has roots going down. And these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society. So here Lord Krishna is mentioning Urdumulam. Adha shakam ashwatam prahur avyayam. So if somebody asks, what about other Vedic injunctions? So Krishna tells there is a banyan tree which is Urdumulam. Other means down. Shakham means branches. The branches are spreading downwards. And Mulam means the root is upwards. So there is a banyan tree. Roots are upwards and the branches are downwards. Ashwat tham prahur. Ashwat means banyan tree. avyayam, chandan, siyas and the Vedic chandas. The Vedic rituals, the verses mentioning the Vedic rituals, they are like the leaves of this tree. And Lord Krishna mentions Yastam Ved. Save person who has understood this tree, he has understood the Vedas. Further. Lord Krishna explains, the branches of this tree extend downward and they go upward again. Nourished by the three modes of material nature. The tree is nourished by water. This tree is being nourished by three modes of nature. The twigs. What are the three modes of nature? Those who are new in this session, we have discussed in the previous four or five classes, you can hear in the podcast. So there are three energies in this material world. And those three energies, they nourish this tree. The twigs are the objects of the senses. The tree also has roots going down. And these are bound to the fruitive actions of human society. So Krishna is telling, although the roots are upwards and the branches are down, but these branches also go upwards and the roots also they come down. So such instance we find in a banyan tree. Shila Prabhupada explains that Prabhupada was quoting somewhere in Calcutta, I suppose, there is a very, very old banyan tree. And this tree is spread in, if I'm not wrong, ten or 20 acres, or even more than that, just one tree is spread in so many acres. And then somebody had announced a prize. Also, if somebody can find the original trunk of this tree, because you cannot make out from original trunk, the branches will shoot up and then it will further come down. Then more trees it will produce. So in this way, one banyan tree can produce many, many banyan trees. The roots go, they come down, they become secondary roots. More trees come up, they produce some other roots. They become the trunks. In this way, banyan keeps on expanding itself. So in many acres, there is single banyan tree. So this is the situation of this banyan tree. So although the roots are upward, but roots also come down and the branches also go up. So this tree, if somebody understands, then he is able to understand all the Vedas. Oh, what is this tree? How do I understand? What is this? Simply by understanding this tree purpose of knowing, all the Vedas is fulfilled. Yes. So this tree is the tree of our material existence. So the material existence is compared to abandoned tree. And that is inverted. Why inverted? Inverted because Prabhupada explains two reasons. First reason is if somebody inverts you upside down, that will be very uncomfortable for us. That is punishment. Third degree torture. Sometimes in jail it is given or to some other first class decoys, it is given such punishment. And some freedom fighters were given such punishments. Sometimes people are tortured. So upside down if somebody keeps you, that is very, very troublesome situation. So in this material world, is Urdumulam adashakam upside down. Okay. Actually, internet is very slow. I will try to connect this thing. Just a moment please. I think the voice is not clear. Some chats have come. Let me try to use another signal. Krishna. Hari. Hari. Hari. Ram. Hari. Ram. Ram. Ram. Hari. Hari. Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna. Krishna. Krishna. Hari. Hari. Hari. Ram. Is it okay? Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna. Krishna. Krishna. Hari. Hari. Hari. Ram. Hari. Ram. Can you please write in the chat box if voice is better now, that is because I'm seeing the chat. That is why it'll go away now. Good. Prabhuji, better. Yes. Presentation is blurred. Okay. Now I think it should come back. Because now we are using voice is totally clear. Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. Now presentation is clear. All right. So I think many of you could not have heard nicely. So let me just repeat. So this Krishna is explaining there is an inverted banyan tree. A person who understands this banyan tree, all the leaves of this banyan tree are compared to the Vedic verses Chandan Siyasya parnani. So there is no need of going through the entirety of Vedic education. Somehow if a person can understand this banyan tree which is inverted. So what is this inverted banyan tree? That is a material existence. So this material existence is compared to a banyan tree. Why? Because banyan tree is very huge. It's difficult to find out the origin. And as I just explained, if my voice was clear, I'll repeat again. Prabhupada explains. There is a banyan tree which is very, very old in Calcutta. It's spread in many, many acre. More than ten and 20 acres. And there was an award. If somebody can find out the original trunk of this banyan tree and so much money would be given. So banyan keeps on producing trunks. From trunks, branches and secondary roots come down. They produce further trees. And one tree can spread into many, many acres. So in this fashion, how our material life has started, it is very, very difficult to trace. That is why we are called Nitya bada. Eternally conditioned. So we are not eternally here in this material world. We belong to spiritual world. But for a very long time we have been conditioned. It is impossible to trace. So that is why this material existence is called banyan tree. It is difficult to trace out the roots and this material world for another reason is called banyan. Because the Banyan tree has got secondary roots. So there is primary root of one original trunk. And then further it sends down its branches again and they become secondary roots. More trees come out. So in a similar fashion the original roots are there. And then when the living entity comes here, he develops attachment and aversion. And this attachment and aversion these becomes secondary roots pious activities if you do and they are called attachments. We are in the bodily concept of life and we think, oh people are also this body. And the suffering of body is taken as suffering of the person. And the person simply tries to take care of the body in the form of various pious activities. In this way one creates good karma. But then that becomes secondary route. Because to reap the results of that good karma again a person has to come back here in this world and actually that service is no real service. That pious service, so called comfort given to the body and mind that anyway is going to come to a person as per the laws of nature. And that will never satisfy a person. Yes, those things are required but those things, good things will anyway happen as per the laws of nature. We should understand the person is not the body and try to render real help to those people. So the real help is to solve the problems for good. So a person wise person Krishna told as we have seen in the previous chapter, a person should rise above the impious activities. One should never commit crime and give harm to other living entities. At the same time, just giving material benefit to other living entities also makes us conditioned in this material world. So impious activities, breaking the laws of nature and pious activities, doing philanthropic activities, both of them are the causes of material bondage because both are done in ignorance. So thus Banyan tree has got primary and secondary roots. Primary tree is forgetfulness of Krishna. Secondary root is pious and impious activity. So a person has to remember Krishna and a person has to give up the pious and impious activity. And why not just banyan tree? It is called inverted banyan tree. Because Prabhupada explains if anybody keeps you inverted upside down that is very very intolerant tolerable situation. The prisoners were kept like that. Some freedom fighters or terrorists, if they cash, they torture people like that. So it's very very uncomfortable. We cannot stay in that asam for a very long time. So that is why in material world people are facing great harassment. Because this is Urdu Molam adharshakam. It is upside down. It is not regular existence. So it is full of misery. And another understanding which is given here by Lord Krishna, Prabhupada explains this have we ever got such experience where the roots are upwards and the branches are downwards. The roots are supposed to be down and the branches go upwards of a tree. So we have such experience. And that is the reflection of tree on the bank of a reservoir of water. So thus another very important understanding which Lord Krishna wants to give us here is this material existence. Some spiritualists they tell it is false. And reality is simply light and light. That's it. From light, from one jyoti this entire world has come up. So we should have some sense. If origin of everything is simply jyoti one energy why so many forms have come about from one light? Light has got intelligence. It is taking so many forms. And why light is taking such forms? What could be the reason? So if in temporary world we have experience of forms it means in eternal world there should be forms. When we dream so many things at night that has got basis all those forms and experiences we have in this world thus it is reflected temporarily in the dream. Similarly if the origin is only light, why at all in the world light would take various forms and shapes. Why would light want to speak, want to talk, want to hear? How will light develop such faculties of hearing, seeing, walking, talking, joking, socializing and all. So this thing is completely rejected by Lord Krishna. This is very important. It is inverted banyan tree means it is reflection. Only in reflection we find a tree where roots are upwards and branches are downwards. So thus this material world is a reflection of reality. There is a real tree which exists. But this tree is reflected. So we see the perverted in a perverted manner. So unless the soul has got capacity to see, why would the soul see? Or why at all? How at all the soul will be able to see using these machines. Eyes do not see. Eyes are simply lenses, camera. So if a person is blind, he cannot see with camera, telescope, microscope, whatever scope. If a person is having eyes, he can see using various instruments and lenses. So if the soul is blind, soul does not have capacity to see. It is simply light. How can the soul see using these eyes? If the soul does not have capacity to see, how can the soul does not have capacity to hear? How can it hear using the ears? So the soul has capacity to hear. Soul has capacity to talk. It is talking using vocal cords. It talks using the mind. And it can talk on spiritual platform also. But we have capacity to talk. So we can talk using our mind. We can talk through these vocal cords also. The soul has capacity to socialize, to have loving relationships. So now in this world we have relationships through these bodies. But originally the soul. So this is very important point. So those who are on satvaguna the brahmanas they are just able to understand. I am not this body which is easy to understand. We have discussed sufficiently the air. We are completely inhaling and exhaling. The blood is there in the body and the blood goes out. The bones also can be replaced. We survive without bones. Sometimes they put steel rod when there is fracture or when there is some organ failure. The organs are also donated. They are changed. So in this way the things of the body can get changed and they are continuously being changed. The food that we eat that makes new cells, old cells are getting continuously destroyed. So bodies we are changing. Vasan si Jinani Yatavihai bodies we are continuously changing. But I am staying throughout this change of body I am observing. So I am different from the body. This is easy to understand. My body is not tasting anything. But I am tasting, eating, laughing in the dream. So to experience the sense objects, I need not have this body. I'm different from this body and mind. But a person who is just satvik, he will understand I am not the body but what is beyond, they will not be able to understand. That is why Lord Krishna tells as we will see in the next verse nobody can understand this tree in this material world. Person has to transcend this material world, become shuddha satvik. Then there is possibility of understanding. So remaining in this dream, can you understand ever? That is dream. We can never understand only a person. When he comes out of dream, he understands oh, that was dream. So thus we have to rise above the modes to understand the reality of this material world. Otherwise we will never it is not possible, Krishna tells to understand this material world. Nobody in this world can understand what is this tree. So thus we have to take instructions from Lord Krishna and not get confused by so many theories. Urdumulam. ADHD Shakam. This tree is reflection. Reflection cannot exist without original. So thus the soul has got form. The soul has got limbs like this. Prabhupada gives very simple example. In the books Krishna mentions vasan si jirani yata Vihai just like the clothes we take and give up at the time of death the soul changes bodies. We are changing bodies life after life. Now the shirt or kurta I am wearing it is having arms. Because I have got arms, I am able to move the arms. Somebody will tell oh, shirt is dancing. Shirt is not dancing. The person is dancing wearing the shirt. So because a person has got, he's moving his hands. So then there is motion in the shirt. Also arms of the shirt. Because the person who is wearing the shirt is moving his arms. In a similar fashion the soul has got limbs and thus it is able to move the limbs of this body. So it is very simple to understand. The shirt is having arms. Suppose a person does not have arms is armless you give that person a shirt with arms, the arms of the shirt will not move because the person is not having arms. So in a similar fashion, all the limbs of the body will work. If the soul has got those limbs and that capacity the soul has got tendency and capacity to walk. It walks using these legs. The soul has capacity to hold, to touch. It experiences touch and holds using these limbs. So it is very very simple to understand. If soul does not have capacity to hold, it cannot hold using best of the things. So it is very very simple and vivid. Example how soul is a person. So soul is a person and there is a real world of personalities. And this is just that is why it is called inverted tree. So if a person is able to understand oh, this is inverted tree and it is not reality, I have to go to reality, then the purpose of studying all the vedas is solved. So if a person simply gets attracted by these leaves which are compared to Vedic rituals and fails to understand the purpose, tree becomes attractive because of its leaves. So if a person gets attracted by the leaves, gets lost and is not able to reach the real tree and another very important question 1 may ask what is the water? The reflection happens in the water. So the real tree is the spiritual world which Lord Krishna will eventually explain. What is that spiritual world where I live? Where people in their real forms they live so that real spiritual world Sanatana Dham is reflected in this form of inverted tree, this material existence. But what is the water? Where are we seeing? What is the basis of this reflection? So it is being explained. The desires are the water material desires. So actually all the problems that we are facing here, the upside down condition which is very very troublesome, this is existing simply because of this water which is called material desires. As soon as the material desires are finished from the heart, all this illusory material existence stops and the living entity realizes the real form of the tree immediately. So we think oh, these desires are very nice and let me fulfill these desires and I'll be happy in that that acts as secondary roots. You cultivate some desires and those desires will produce new branches and you get transported to different branch and eat some fruits which are coming out of that branch. In this way, from one branch to another, living entity keeps on hopping but is never satisfied. It is not normal situation for living entity. So thus Lord Krishna mentions here next narupamasiha Tato palabhate Nanto Nachadir nachasam prateshta ashvatam anam suvirudhamulam asang shastrana drana Chitwa tata padam tat parimargitavyam Yasmin Gatana Nivartanti Bhuyah tam Avam Chadhyam Purusham Prapadi Yata Pravati prasrishta Purani it means the real form of this tree cannot be perceived in this world. No one can understand where it ends, where it begins, or where its foundation is. But with determination, one must cut down this tree with the weapon of detachment. So doing, one must seek that place. Now Krishna is telling it is difficult now. Rupa Masayha Tato Palabhyate Antaha Adi you cannot make out the beginning and end of this tree. You cannot understand what is the real form of the tree, what is the expanse of this tree. And Parikshit Maharaj vaniya Shukdya Goswami personality, who is liberated from birth, the most advanced spiritualist of that time, and of course now also Shugdhya Goswami is existing. So Shukda Goswami, when he was asked to explain the situation of this material world, the planets of this material universe, which is very small, shukda Goswami told even with a lifespan of Brahma, it's difficult to understand. But I will repeat as I understood from the authorities, what we can understand. And there are so many dimensions, so many aspects to it, so many living entities all moving around, unable to see. We are very, very limited. So Shukda Goswami told us, I have heard, I am explaining to you, but it is difficult to understand. Even with a lifetime of Brahma, that is the biggest lifetime, trillions of years. So Anta Adar, one cannot understand, one cannot figure out this material world. Still, Lord Krishna tells you, cut down this tree. You are able to see or not? You cut it down and how you cut it down. What is the weapon for cutting it down? Asanga shastra shastra. The weapon is asanga detachment. So people think, if I read Bhagavad Gita, I'll become detached. Actually, detachment is the biggest asset. Without detachment, there is no question of happiness. We are getting attached on false platform onto temporary things which produce problems and miseries. So detachment is the beginning of happiness. Ashanga Satrayana Dreyana Chitwa so with the weapon of detachment, you cut down this tree, and then not you simply remain satisfied by cutting down this tree. As some transcendentalists who are not advanced impersonalists, they are satisfied understanding this material world is not reality. And they cannot understand what is reality. So Krishna is telling tata padam tat parimargitavyam yasmin Gatana nivartanti Bhuya. One then should find out a padam the situation parimargitavyam one has to search that place where Yasmin gata if a person goes there nanivartanti Bhuya, he does not come back again to this reflected portion. So you should go to a place going where a person does not come back. And what is that place? Some impersonal light? No, that Krishna has already explained by the example of reflection. Further, Lord Krishna tells in that place you'll find purush, you'll find the supreme Personality of God, you'll find a person and adyam purush. We are having so many purushas here, but we are not adyam purush. We are not the origin. We have got our origin in the form of our Father. So although we cannot. Understand the expanse of this tree and the real nature. Still one has to find from where this tree has begun. We have come from our father, father has come from his father. What is the origin from where it has started? And in this way Lord Krishna tells a person has to reach that platform on which he is able to find that Adyam Purusham tamusham prapadhya prapadhya means surrender. So Lord Krishna is telling understand that position reaching which here anywhere you go, you have to come down here on this earth. So you do good credits. Punya karma. You do. You go to heavenly planets. You have a life of very less disease. Lot of power. You can control rains, clouds, planets, wind, air, fire and so many things. The food that we eat, our vocal cords, even how much we have to evacuate. And the evacuation process is also being controlled by the demigods. So from eating to evacuation, everything is under strict control of the devatas. So a person can control all these universal affairs. You become very powerful but you remain there as long as you have. punyas shine pune martha lokamashanti. So just like we go for foreign trips, when the money is exhausted, you come back again. You earn money and then again when there is good profit again you go for another trip. And sometimes in this enjoyment you break the laws of nature. Then you go to jail. In this a person goes to heaven and then goes to hell. But he keeps on circulating in this way. In this material world he has to come back again to this place. And again he has to earn pious or impious credits again go for enjoyment or suffering. So nivartante he keeps on coming back. Death happens again, birth happens. But you have to find out a place whereby if you reach, you do not have to come back again. In this situation of repeated birth, death, old age and disease. And that place is not place of impersonal energy but that place is dominated by Adyam Purusham, the original person. And there you surrender to that person. Yata Pravriti prasrita Purani from whom this entire thing has begun since time immemorial. So now Srila Prabhupada explains very nicely. It is now clearly stated that the real form of this banyan tree cannot be understood in this material world. Since the root is upwards, the extension of the real tree is at the other end. No one can see how far the tree extends nor can one see the beginning of this tree. Yet one has to find out the cause. So one very important word which is used here is Ashanga Shastriana as we have discussed. Now 1 may ask Prabhu how to get this weapon. As one of our devotees, he was meeting some people and then he came across a person and he became very glad to meet him. And he know when I was young I was there in this college, I think Nasik or somewhere. So when I was undergoing education, I also came in touch with the Hare Krishna devotees. And I was chanting very nicely, I was avoiding and garlic and I was willing to become like you. But then somehow I took this path. Now, although materially, he's very successful and very powerful and very rich. But he's telling now I'm completely lost. Now I'm eating meat and I have my family and we have lot of money. But I'm not satisfied. I want more money. I want nice bike for myself and big cars for myself. Although I'm having, I want even more. So prabhu. I cannot come out now. I am lost. So even though I know it is not good, but I am getting happiness now in this material world, in this material enjoyment. So it is very very difficult to develop this detachment. So Krishna is telling this weapon is required to cut down this tree of illusion and solve our miseries. But then how to develop this asanga Shastrana? So Prabhupada explains here therefore one must learn detachment. Please read carefully second paragraph here therefore, one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on authoritative scriptures. And two things are there. First, discussion of spiritual science based on authoritative scriptures. And one must hear from persons who are actually in knowledge. So two things discussion of what not mundane affairs. How this person got arrested, how that scam happened, how the government has proposed nice agenda, how the government is corrupt. No, these temporary things will come and go again. Good governance will come. Your Dhishir Maharaj will come with Krishna. Krishna will come, lord Ramchandra will come and corrupt people will come. So material world is like that. The waves come and go. Spring season comes, then summers, then winters. So one should not bother about temporary affairs much. But one must hear from persons who are actually in knowledge and discuss the spiritual science based on the scriptures. As a result of such discussion in the association of devotees, one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So thus whatever process we are following here, just it is very strictly based on the Bhagavad Gita and whatever Prabhupada is writing here, that is strictly as per the injunctions of the other vedas satam Prasangat, Mamavira Samvido, Bhavanti Ritkarna, Rasayana Katha, Satam Prasangat. There is a very strong injunction in the Vedas that in the association of devotees only the devotional service becomes relishable. So just before this session, one devotee was telling the instance of another devotee who was doing very nice seva. Somehow he could not do seva. So he's having his own family now. He's moved out of city because of COVID and he's standing 16 rounds and wants to take initiation. But now his situation is he cannot avoid even onion and garlic. So Prahutol, you were aspiring of taking initiation. Now you cannot even avoid onion, garlic. He will flow situation is like that. What to do? So without association of devotees spiritual life remains a dream. If at all a person is following some rituals, it will be very shallow and person will not develop taste. That relish will not develop. So spiritual life becomes mature only when the bird sits on the eggs. The embryo becomes mature and the chick comes out. So devotional service, the fruit of devotional service becomes mature and we get taste in it only in the warmth of devotees. In the association of devotees this is very very important. That is why Lord Krishna tells bodhayanta parasparam tushyanti charamanticha kathyanta Chamam nityam. So what is the quality of devotees? Bodhayanta parasparam? They keep on enlightening each other by discussing these topics. So Krishna is telling other vedas are telling, sages are telling this discussion bo theam this is very very important. And it is common sense also any subject matter, if we have to understand, we have to have discussion on that. That is why we have various conferences. So so much discussion is required. So what is this? That logic. So many things. And there is a planning commission. They keep on discussing how to take this country forward. So we all work in various our workplaces. And how much discussion happens, how to make the company more profitable. The similar discussion is required for under. They have so much discussion about markets, so much discussion about finances, so much discussion about family affairs. So is discussion not required to become expert in spiritual life? It is required. Very much required. So in the association of devotees we have to discuss, it is very important. And also here if you don't hear, simply discuss what we will discuss. So that is why we have this Bhagavad Gita series. So twice in a week you can hear and other times other days you can hear from Prabhupada. And we have discussion also every day in the form of RDA Bhakti Raksha sessions. So please participate very sincerely. These are strictly as per the Vedic injunctions. And this discussion when you advance, it would be so relishable in Ashram we just find time to discuss these subject matters with other devotees. It is so enlivening enlightening. And by the discussion we advance in our knowledge we get this weapon of detachment. So the word asanga so materialist, if you discuss matter with them, you become attached. You discuss about opposite sex. That is a talk in school, colleges and workplaces and everywhere person dies talking of these things. So when I was very new in the movement and I was sent to a new place and I thought how to start things here? Okay, Prabhupada started doing ridanga, let us also do something. So we two devotees were there. So we started going and doing nagar Sankiran in the park. And one devotee will take Midanga, another will take Kartal and both of us will go and do this thing. So various people would come for jogging. And some old people we found and one of the persons in the group, he started taking pleasure in bhajan keertan that we were doing there. So we thought, okay, these old people, they have seen this life and now I think they are good candidates for spiritual realization. One person is showing interest also. So we stopped for a while and we did there. And the next day where they were sitting, these six, seven old people, we sat there and we continued bhajan akirtan over there. So some people became little this thing. And we understood something is wrong. Then one person eventually told, and you don't understand, please we discuss all kinds of jokes and other things and we cannot talk in front of you. And then he told what kind of jokes they discuss. Then we folded hands, we went away. So I told this is the situation these the kids are discussing in the colleges and schools. And they are at the fag end of their lives till they are engaged in such lusty jokes and other discussions. So this lust never goes from the heart as there is a story. Akbar wanted to ask that when this lust will go away from the heart. He asked Birbal, so Birbal told you, please be ready, I will give you answer at suitable time. He told, okay. So one day Birbal approached Akbar. So my Lord, please come, we have to go. Where? Don't ask question, please come with me. I have to take you out gently to someplace. And please bring your young princes along with you. So all three of them, they reached and near a hut and he told, now here is an old person, he is on his deathbed about to pass away at any moment. So all three of us will go inside and you please carefully observe him where he's looking. He told, okay. And they went inside. And then Akbar is there. Akbar the great. And how much a person should be awe inspired to see the great king in his house. But Akbar noticed what Birbal was about to point out and they came out and Birbal asked Akbar, did you notice? So although Akbar was talking king has come. But the gaze of the old man was fixed upon the young daughter of Akbar. So you told, you saw, you were asking me that day till what time lust remains in the body. It remains till deathbed. Unless a person practices detachment. So material desires will not go away from the heart. Unless a person practices body may fail to respond but desires are there in the heart. So thus Lord Krishna is telling here this weapon of Asanga is required to cut down this illusion. And how one person gets this weapon. Therefore one must learn detachment by discussion of spiritual science based on authoritative scriptures. And one must hear from persons who are actually in knowledge. So simply by hearing, please don't mistake it to be an ordinary process. Just hear here. Here. Entire day here I've shared Prabhupadi website. Bhaktivedanta library app is there. Prabhupada audiobooks are there. So just keep on hearing Prabhupada's lectures and the audiobooks of Prabhupada the entire day as much as possible. You are going for morning walk. You are working in the house. Cleaning, cutting, cooking, sweeping, whatever whenever possible. In between you keep on hearing. Hearing. Hare Krishna, Mahamantra or the Vedas audiobooks or the lectures of Prabhupada. Keep on hearing the entire day. It will act like magic. Punya shamana Kirtana unless we have sufficient punya it is not possible to understand. Unless we come to Satbhuna it is not possible to understand this subject matter. So punya is required. Faith will not come unless a person has sufficient punya. So by hearing, hearing, hearing our punya is increasing. So just keep on hearing. We are understanding, not understanding. If we hear with the raptor tension, we advance very fast. Otherwise also simply keep on hearing, hearing, hearing. So first thing is hearing but hearing from persons who are actually in knowledge. Not who have just mugged up Bhagavad Gita but who have realization following the parampara and discussion of spiritual science based on authoritative scriptures. As a result of such discussion in the association of devotees one comes to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As a result of such discussion in the association of devotees then what I'm supposed to do? Then I will be able to feel the presence of Krishna. When proper discussion happens then in every step of our life we'll be able to feel presence of Krishna. Then the first thing one must do is surrender to Him. We have realized krishna dadyam purusham. When the punya is sufficient we are following regulative principles. We are living in the association of devotees. Then all the doubts will be cleared. All the doubts are because of sinful activities of the past. Mind does not become concentrated because of sins of the past. Any disturbance of the body in the form of diseases, pain et cetera or any turmoil of the mind. It simply happens because of sinful activities. So if we follow four principles, strictly regulative principles and we are cultivating this hearing process then as soon as we are free from the sense entire life would be clear. We will understand what is adyampurush original person, what is this world, what is the aim of life? So when we are able to understand this thing with firm conviction what we are supposed to do is the first thing one must do is surrender to him. Completely surrender to Krishna. Now I have maintained my independence enough. But I understand if I remain surrendered to you. That is a perfection of life. My real life starts. The description of that place where when is going no one returns to this false reflected tree is given here. The Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna is the original root from whom everything has emanated to gain favor of that personality of Godhead one has only to surrender and this is a result of performing devotional service by hearing, chanting etc. So without favor of Krishna we cannot understand this world. We cannot get spiritual happiness and what a person has to do to gain that favor only one thing one only has to surrender. But unless a person gets clarity how one can surrender? So that is why this clarity this surrenderance person can gain by performing devotional service, hearing, chanting et cetera in the association of devotees. So I request all of you process is very very simple please follow very strictly this somehow or other please arrange in your life association of devotees and everything will be taken care just please in this life live with devotees. Find out devotees. If you are single we have many facilities for you full time where you can live and cultivate nicely. If you are married try to find out a temple which is close to you devotee community close to you or some other Grassas and live with them together perform morning and evening program but please live with devotees in this life. Then spiritual life becomes mature, it becomes relishable and clarity comes. We are able to discuss, we are able to hear and we are able to understand Krishna perceive Krishna and surrender to him. And by only surrendering we can get favor of supreme just we need to surrender that's it and spiritual life becomes perfect. So with this we will end this discussion. Now we'll follow this process which will help us to have realization of God which will help us in getting association with devotees and that is chanting and hearing of Hare Krishna Mahamantra. So those devotees who are new I am sharing the link of if you have missed any of the previous sessions, the recordings you'll find in the podcast and if you are very new you want more details of our sessions you can please contact Srisha Prabhu. So here is the number. If you want a mentor for yourself or have elaborate discussion about something else please feel free to contact him and join Telegram channel for other downloads and updates. Now we'll chant this Hari Krishna Mahamantra 21 times and after that we'll take up questions. So please be very attentive since will not allow us to be rapidly attentive but if we are endeavoring to that extent we'll be able to get freed from the sinful reactions.
