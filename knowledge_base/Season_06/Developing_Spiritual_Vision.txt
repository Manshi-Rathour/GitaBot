So Krishna clarified to Arjuna.
Although Sankhya Yoga, the practices of Ashtanga Yoga are being described in this chapter, nevertheless,
Karma Yoga is a very simple process which everybody can follow in this age, offering the results to Krishna.
But whatever process you may follow, the yogic process is ultimately meant to control the mind.
Unless mind is controlled, any advancement without control of mind and senses, it is impossible in spiritual life.
Because the senses and mind, they keep a person chained on the material platform.
So this is the standard process which people would follow when they were very qualified in Satyoga.
Mind and senses were anyway under control. They were very, very tolerant, very peaceful.
So this process was possible. But anyway, because it's a process, Krishna is recommending Arjuna.
Krishna also explained, as we saw in the previous verse, there are two stages of yoga.
In the beginning, action is required. A person cannot completely stop all the activities of the senses.
However, in the advanced stage, a person is supposed to stop the activities of the senses.
And that is the means of spiritual advancement.
But then whatever you are doing, initial stages or advanced stages, the objective of yoga should not be forgotten.
The initial objective. And that is, Lord Krishna is mentioning now in this verse.
Ultimately, you are very fond of doing yoga, but please understand from Bhagavad Gita for what yoga should be done.
So let us see that now in these verses we are going to learn today.
Lord Krishna mentions in verse number five.
So here you see many times, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine times, atma word is used.
Uddhared means one must deliver atmana, atmanam. One should deliver atma by atma.
What does it mean? Why the same word?
So it gets clarified in the translation and purported by Srila Prabhupada.
Srila Prabhupada translates.
So Srila Prabhupada explains, which you can find in Sanskrit dictionaries also.
It also means super soul and it also means intelligence.
Somebody thinks that self means body, I am this body, lump of matter.
Some people think I am mind. Some people think, no, I am controlling the mind.
So actually we are intelligence.
Some people are able to understand the level of soul.
And then atma also denotes the supreme atma, param atma, the super soul.
So how do we understand that all these atma have different words used here?
They convey soul, super soul, intelligence, mind or body.
That is why it is very important to get the instructions of Bhagavad Gita in parampara.
Without parampara, if we understand, we will be lost.
First of all, instructions will not be effective.
And even before being effective, we may not be able to understand the direct meaning itself.
Because every word we see is conveying so many meanings.
That is why in the fourth chapter it is mentioned.
So many, many speakers want to speak of so-called spiritual speakers.
Some motivational speakers also are using Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita to explain something.
So please we should reject them immediately.
We should ask them, what is your parampara?
Do you have a guru who has come in parampara who is passing down the correct meaning?
Has he been authorized to pass down the meaning from his previous guru?
So are you belonging to any line of authority?
And if the person tells, sorry, I do not, it is my understanding.
Please reject that person immediately.
Instead of helping us in spiritual life, that will contribute to spiritual disaster.
We will not remain neutral.
Wrong meaning means spiritual disaster, obviously.
Like one person, some people tell, no, Prabhu, it's almost the same meaning written.
No, not almost the same meaning.
One small mistake, as I explained in the previous sessions.
One person was very fond of reading Bhagavad Gita, Mahabharata.
He got the commentary from somebody.
Other things were OK.
Krishna is telling you should practice detachment for peace of mind and for spiritual development.
And then finally writes one line.
Detachment from sense objects and detachment also from Krishna.
From Krishna also you should be detached.
So he started practicing detachment from Krishna only.
So just see what a disaster it is.
Krishna further is telling in Bhagavad Gita.
Absorb your mind in me, absorb your intelligence in me.
So my mind should be completely attached to me.
You should take shelter of me in this way.
But anyway, those people who have shallow understanding, they can create disaster.
So that is why we should simply find out where is an authorized parampara.
We can understand it.
We can understand it.
We can understand it.
We can understand it.
We can understand it.
We can understand it.
We can understand it.
We can understand it.
is why we should simply find out where is an authorized parampara and then take knowledge from
that person. So here Shri Prabhupada is explaining in the yoga system the mind and the conditioned
soul are specially important. Since mind is the central point of yoga practice, atma refers here
to the mind. The purpose of yoga system is to control the mind and to draw it away from
attachment to sense objects. So purpose of yoga system is to control the mind and after controlling
what are you supposed to do? Some people ask, Prabhu, please tell me how can I control my mind?
My mind is very disturbed. Why? Because he is not able to focus on fruity work, some job or business
which will help him in getting sense objects. But that is not the purpose of yoga and for this
purpose people are doing yoga so that they can work hard to attain sense objects. Rather it is
a converse. The mind should be drawn away from the attachment to sense objects. So that is why
before I tell them before you ask me the question please tell me how to control the mind you should
ask why should I control the mind? By controlling the mind what I am supposed to do so it should be
taken away from sense objects then you should control. It is stressed here in that the mind
must be so trained that it can deliver the conditioned soul from the mire of nescience.
In material existence one is subjected to the influence of the mind and the senses.
We all realize mind is constantly impacting us and the senses are also pulling and pushing us.
So that is called material existence. Spiritual existence means the liberated personalities also
come here or some people become liberated here. Although they are within this mind and body
but they are not at all affected by the mind and body that is called living in a shell of this body
completely detached and unaffected. But material existence means so that is why we tell how do we
how do we understand he's a spiritualist he's also walking talking seeing and everything is
there no but the spiritualist Jeevan Mukta liberated soul within this body he is not affected by all
such activities. These activities happen automatically by the modes of nature as we have seen in previous
chapters of Bhagavad Gita. So mind should be so trained that it should deliver the conditioned soul
from the mire of nescience. So in here we are influenced by mind and senses. In fact the pure
soul is entangled in the material world because of mind's ego which desires to lord it over material
nature. So we saw a video which I had shown previously in Jigyasa sessions how they catch
a monkey. Monkey is so full of activity very difficult how will you catch it jumps from
one tree to another tree. So same thing monkey as we had seen in that video so it is caught
using two means so sometimes in a coconut shell or sometimes in an anthill they make a small hole
the tribals simple people they make one small hole and they put some nuts inside and the monkey
is watching oh this person is putting something inside so monkey is very inquisitive and monkey
knows oh these are nuts he's putting so I will enjoy the nuts and then when he sees that this
person has gone away the hunter or whatever the tribal tribesman and then he puts his hand inside
and that hole is so made that open hand can go inside but closed hand can either go inside and
once gone cannot come outside also so monkey puts his hand inside and then grabs hold fistful of
nuts but then because the fist is there hands are closed the hand doesn't come out and that
video is so funny the monkey is crying and he is begging please leave me he's thinking somebody
has caught his hand but actually nobody has caught his hand it is a monkey only who wants
to lord over the nuts which do not belong to the monkey anyway monkey is not going to enjoy the
nuts ever but this desire not to leave the nuts gets the monkey captured the freedom is lost
sometimes the monkey is killed and people eat its meat sometimes the hormones are used to improve
the sexual power and in this way the monkey's harness for various reasons and loses its freedom
or loses its life why because it wanted to enjoy some nuts which did not belong to him
and which anyway he'll never be able to enjoy but he cannot open his fist simply if the monkey
opens its fist monkey's free nobody can catch him but he's not willing to open his fist in a desire
I can take out the nuts that is not the design of the trap that until in a similar fashion
mind creates an ego that I am this body and then I want to enjoy the sense objects lord over this
nature which does not belong to me and although a person is never able to enjoy to its heart content
but he does not leave he is not willing to let go and thus he's trapped in this messians
therefore the mind should be trained so that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material
nature monkey should be so trained that monkey should not be attracted by those nuts
so that is why this is the training which a person should do for yoga practice mind should be so
trained that it will not be attracted by the glitter of material nature and in this way the
conditioned soul may be saved one should not degrade oneself by attraction to sense objects
the more one is attracted by sense objects the more one becomes entangled in material existence
so just see totally reverse condition is mentioned here we are very much attracted to sense objects
we are working hard just to enjoy the sense objects but the understanding is which krishna
is giving the more one is attracted by the sense objects the more one becomes entangled in material
existence so somebody was asking in the previous class and people keep on asking
that this bhagavad gita is imagination and you know why you're for where is imagination is this
imagination krishna is telling one who has conquered his mind who has taken mind away from
sense objects mind is friend and one whose mind is uncontrolled mind is greatest enemy
so isn't it common sense the more you are attracted or your mind is attracted by the sense objects
the more one becomes entangled in material existence so it is not giving us any happiness
it is only entangling so please understand this point over and over again unless we are completely
convinced that yes i should not be attracted by sense objects sense objects are not at all
adding even a pinch to my happiness rather it is a converse the more a person is renounced
the more he feels bliss and happiness in this material world
it is common sense that we should not fall for addictions
we tell our children please do not get addicted to computer game alcohol smoking drugs or so many
other addictions we know addictions are bad addictions create only misery but we explain
to the children we explain to our friends why don't we understand that we are all addicted only
sense object enjoyment means addiction we do not need it but once we start enjoying it we become
entangled we cannot live without it we do not need it when we took birth when we were small were we
desiring oh the love of my life when he or she will come to my life but now that we have created
this artificial attachment to some person we cannot live without him or her and then people
or her and then people become depressed they leave their lives it is artificial necessity
which we created in our life if we were not enjoying our favorite movies or cricket matches
were we desiring that oh when that movie will be released and i would see no sense object came in
front of us and mine became attracted by the glitter of the sense object oh when will i have
this car were we always imagining that car before we saw it no the mind became attracted by that
rubbish tin can rubbish as long as not used for spiritual seva
so thus we should understand all of us are attracted all of us are addicted only
anybody who is in material world he is having addiction thus this is the purpose of yoga system
i should not degrade if a person is getting attracted to sense objects then what is happening
entanglement happiness is only possible happiness means you are not at all conditioned by these
sense objects because sense object will be present some time will not be present one
sometime when it is not present we are hankering when will i have when will i have and when it
goes away there is a nature of time then we lament oh it has gone it has gone hankering lamentation
in this way person spends his entire life and wastes his valuable human form of life
and then again he takes birth in lower species becomes animal because all he has done in human
life is sense enjoyment human life is not designed for that nature will give us suitable
body you do sense enjoyment only so we see we become entangled now we have conditioned
ourselves to that sense object now if i do not watch this cricket match i'll become disturbed oh
oh so if i do not get this rank if i do not perform nicely in this quarter i'll become
disturbed oh i become disturbed the society doesn't praise me like they are praising in my small
classes i'll become disturbed so just see we have become more entangled my happiness and distress
is subject to some external things if i do not eat this thing i become disturbed taste is not
there in food i become disturbed so i have pegged my happiness to all these different objects
so i am becoming helpless and one or the other thing will not be present or will
not be to our liking and thus we are subject to miseries so isn't it common sense so well
what is imagination in bhagavad-gita everything is solid fact bhagavad-gita also does not mention
very strong powerful personalities we are unable to conceive their power so we think it is imagination
it is just philosophy where is imagination in this without reading people tell imagination yes
mahabharat if you read you'll find extraordinary display of opulence and power which people were
having so anyway read bhagavad-gita it is just common sense plain sense the more one is attracted
by sense objects you are entangled in material existence and you create miseries for yourself
so thus we all are addicted so please read these purports controlling the mind four to eight
very very important the purpose is to train the mind mind should not be attracted by the glitter
of sense objects so i should see i am not getting attracted by the sense objects just like i become
horrified seeing some you know any addictive thing oh no no i should not do this similarly once you
start doing it you become addicted and then life is miserable but then yes there is
per se misery in this material world why because we are missing that enjoyment which we have
only by having a loving relationship with krishna because we have forgotten that now we want to
have the same ecstasy same feeling by somehow enjoying the objects of this material world
what is missing in our life is krishna nothing else because if even if you attain everything
else as people have done they are not satisfied but a person who has loving devotional service
of krishna he's completely satisfied so there's the proof so simply try to add krishna in our life
and then we will not find anything is missing in our life then we'll be able to control the
mind and senses so that is why she writes now how to do this herculean task of not letting
the mind be attracted by sense objects there are various ways this is one way you analyze and you
sit down and after analysis who am i within this body i am not bones i am not blood i am not finger
i am not my eyes and then you meditate by this breathing process this practice when you regulate
diets in the body in a certain which means the soul is floating then mind becomes very very
peaceful not attracted by the sense objects so how we become attracted there is a process you
have to see that sense object first of all to become attracted and then you have to enjoy it
the signal goes and then there is wiring in the brain then the attraction addiction starts
so there is a process so there is a counter process also this ashtanga yoga teaches us
counter process unique way of if we follow then we will not be able to
mechanical disengagement from sense object but this is these are not the best processes these
are not for the wise people the best way to disentangle oneself is to always engage the
mind in krishna consciousness when mind is having positive pleasure positive happiness automatically
it will not go for lower pleasures so krishna consciousness is the best way but substandard
ways are recommended here so that arjuna vc can reject it and it is an instruction follow all of
us when arjuna could not follow how can i follow so that is why it is told in the vedas another
statement for a man mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of
of liberation mind absorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage and mind detached from
the sense objects is the cause of liberation same mind same gun terrorist uses he's hanged
same gun soldier uses he's given awards and very many benefits similarly it is very powerful like
a gun our mind same mind will be cause of bondage and the same mind is cause of liberation then what
is the difference mind absorbed in sense objects is the cause of bondage and mind detached from
the sense objects is the cause of liberation therefore the mind which is always engaged in
krishna consciousness is the cause of supreme liberation so when the mind is detached from the
sense objects you are liberated there are five kinds of liberation but there is one liberation
which is supreme of that of krishna consciousness so that is possible when the mind is engaged in
krishna consciousness then you are not just liberated you are supremely liberated you are
very advanced in liberation then lord krishna mentions so lord krishna mentioned here
one should elevate himself by the mind and not degrade himself
that can happen with anything with money you can elevate yourself you can degrade yourself
similarly with your mind you can elevate yourself you can degrade yourself
so elevate yourself using your mind and not degrade yourself so the mind is friend and the
enemy also then whose mind is friend whose mind is enemy krishna explains in the next verse
for him who has conquered the mind the mind is best of the friends
but for one who has failed to do so his mind will be the greatest enemy
the purpose of practicing eightfold yoga is to control the mind in order to make it friend
in discharging the human mission this is the purpose human life is a mission
mission for stopping birth and death realizing one's true identity
and for this we have to do friendship with the mind unless the mind is controlled the practice
of yoga is simply a waste of time so people ask proof how do we know there are various
process we can do anything other from chanting no so we ask them have you got the result of
your yoga you have been doing whatever sadhana kriya or japa tapa whatever you are doing
but has it given you control of mind then it is you can understand your mind is not controlled
so it is simply a waste of time i also was following one such practice and other practices
i have tried so yes that time definitely we are in trance and when my friends would invite that
please come to temple and you know it is appearance day of lord ram chandra some other festival i
would tell what happens in temple you know i have been visiting temple but
this is something practical when you sit and meditate control your breath and then you
you feel such an amazing trance but that trance is only for that time and maybe it continues for
some time once you are out but senses sensual control is very difficult
controlling mind is very very difficult for that time you'll get some relief that is a fact but
you will not get the result of controlling mind and senses so that is why it is simply a waste of
time so one who cannot control his mind he always lives with lives always with greatest enemy
so enemies not outside we are thinking or somebody some other person will cause some harm to me
some other person will cause some harm to me my competitors they are learning more coding than me
they will advance more he is doing better business than me he's scoring more marks than me no sir
they will not be able to harm you our own mind is our greatest enemy who is uncontrolled
and thus his life and mission are spoiled the constitutional position of the living entity
very important krishna is mentioning is to carry out the order of the superior
as long as one's mind remains unconquered enemy one has to serve the dictations of
lust anger every solution etc people are so foolish you give them bhagavad gita and they will tell
no i want freedom i don't want to live my life as per a book as per the codes mentioned in a book
that is too much but they don't realize in madness they are servants servants of lust
morning to evening lust is haunting them and various celebrities bureaucrats ministers
they have lost their illustrious career students because of lust
the richest person former richest person lost half of its his wealth because of lust
we are servants of our anger we are servants of avarice illusion
and servants of so many other such anomalies in material world we are servants servants of
all our senses dictations of mind body and other people external situations so we are
anyway a helpless servant of so many other things simply if we decide to become servant of krishna
or a spiritual or his representative or spiritual master we will be free from all other services
from all other services
so it is not that following rules and regulations of sadhana bhakti bhagavad gita puts in bondage
you are already in so much bondage you are servant of so many unwanted things
you'll become free but because the people are mad they talk like that mad talks
but when the mind is conquered one voluntarily agrees to abide by the dictation of personality
of godhead who is situated within the heart of everyone as parmatma so mind is not conquered so
that is why we are not able to hear the voice of parmatma god who is sitting in the heart
so when the mind is not at all attracted by the sense objects automatically it will follow
parmatma because mind has to follow the superior dictation real yoga practice entails meeting the
parmatma now what is the purpose of yoga you have been in yoga for a very long time have you met
parmatma within your heart the soul is in the heart we are within the heart and parmatma is
also within so we have to meet parmatma and then what we are supposed to do meet and film
no then following his dictation then parmatma will guide life is still not perfect
then parmatma will guide us into bhakti yoga
so not everyone is so wise to understand that krishna has given the instructions krishna only
is parmatma spiritual master is manifestation of parmatma bhagavata mentions
acharya mam vijaniyam navamanyeta karhichid acharya mam vijaniyam krishna is mentioning
acharya should be considered non-different from me because we cannot hear the voice of parmatma
from me because we cannot hear the voice of parmatma within the heart parmatma manifests
himself in the form of spiritual master so those who are very wise are able to understand these
facts they surrender to a pure devotee spiritual master who is manifestation of parmatma and they
follow his advice navamanyeta karhichid krishna is telling never disobey such guru
so that is parmatma's mercy so those who are not so wise they want to know no i want to see
parmatma only okay they see parmatma they meet parmatma within the heart and then they follow
the dictation of parmatma but one who takes to krishna consciousness directly perfect surrender
to dictation of lord follows automatically you take to krishna consciousness these are instructions
of krishna only he has spoken come outside and then he has spoken everything because we cannot
hear from inside so those who are wise they take to krishna consciousness directly and the purpose
of meeting parmatma is already resolved they have gone further higher stage so that is our
bhakti yoga is so supremely powerful need not waste time in searching for parmatma by following
a difficult process of simply the instructions are there follow it what parmatma is going to
speak to you directly it has been mentioned here with the help of a guru spiritual master we
implement it this is real yoga practice so as the yogis have you met parmatma are you taking
dictation from him otherwise it is unsuccessful
for one who has conquered the mind the super soul is already reached for he has attained tranquility
to such a man happiness and distress heat and cold honor and dishonor are all the same
so shilpa upad explains
actually every living entity is intended to abide by the dictation of supreme personality
of godhead who is seated in heart as parmatma when the mind is misled by the external illusory
energy one becomes entangled in material activities therefore as soon as one's mind is controlled
through one of the yoga systems purpose of all yoga system is to control the mind one is to be
considered as already having reached their destination one has to abide by superior
dictation when one's mind is fixed on the superior nature he has no other alternative
but to follow the dictation of the supreme we have to follow some dictation just like when the
weak soldiers are captured or some soldier is captured they give him
or terrorist is captured they give him option now you follow the dictation of your masters or we
follow our dictation if you follow our dictation you will be rewarded if you follow their dictation
we will punish you so dictation has to be followed by a captured person in a similar fashion we are
very small we will follow the dictation either of illusion maya durga devi or that of lord krishna
so when you are not following the dictations of illusion then automatically you will follow
the dictations of parmatma seated in the heart so that is why it is told here one who has conquered
the mind super soul is already reached for years that in tranquility he becomes very tranquil
one who has conquered the mind is always very peaceful and to such a man happiness distress
heat cold honor dishonor the whole anxiety in world is because of this stupid thing called honor
we are traveling in a coach we want to get some honor temporarily and i forget the purpose for
which i am traveling and waste their travel so but a person who is whose mind is controlled
honor and dishonor it is same thus he is liberated so much time we are wasting just to have some
honor and avoid dishonor but a person whose mind is controlled honor dishonor happiness just says
it is the same he does not waste any moment increasing temporary happiness mitigating
material distress improving temporary honor removing the dishonor it is all the same for
such a person he does not see any difference between them and then on such a platform when
the mind is controlled you are successful already so somehow or the other we should come to the
point of controlling the mind when the mind is controlled not attracted by sense objects
super soul is already reached it will follow the dictations of super soul
because this transcendental position is at once achieved by one who is in krishna consciousness
the devotee of the lord is unaffected by dualities of material existence
distress happiness cold heat this state is practical samadhi or absorption in supreme
so this state is easily attained by one who is following krishna consciousness
so then what are the further symptoms of a person who has attained the state of controlling the mind
having attained super soul
a person is said to be established in self-realization and is called a yogi when he is fully satisfied by
virtue of acquired knowledge and realization such a person is situated in transcendence
and is self-controlled he sees everything whether it be pebbles stones or gold as the same
so whether somebody is successful in yoga or not we can test it by this he sees everything
he's self-controlled first of all and pebbles stone or gold all are the same
pebbles stone or gold all are the same we collect gold give so much value to gold but a person who
is yogi who is situated in transcendence for him it is same pebbles stones gold
so that is why shiloh prabhupada is mentioning very important line
in the purport book knowledge without realization of the supreme truth is useless
so we know all the bookish knowledge we know the shlokas but this realization is not there i am
attracted to gold and i am indifferent to stones so then it is of no use it is useless there is no
need of reading them if you are not able to realize at all so reading should be done with
strong desire to realize that truth or when will the platform come when i will be able to perfectly
when i will be able to perfectly remain in self-control situation when will that stage
come that honor and dishonor are all the same for me i am not at all hankering for any honor
i am not at all afraid of any dishonor i do not make any distinction between pebbles stones or
gold when that stage will come so vedas mention the vedanta sutra vedas are meant to establish
explain three truths sambandh abhidheya and prayojan all these three truths have to be
understood that is called perfection of knowledge of absolute truth sambandh means what is my
relationship with absolute truth with god if you join a company you should know what is my
relationship i am recruited in which position and then second is abhidheya we start acting
we start acting in that position but then it is very important to understand prayojan for
what i am acting i need money from this job i need something else for what i am doing it
so that is why if we are if we are knowing the sambandha we have known the relationship
but we do not act in that relationship oh yes yes he is she is my wife i am husband
now you have to act in that relationship if there is no activity now there is some
responsibility you have to do that and then when we act in that relationship then prayojan
what is the prayojan of marriage to get a child then prayojan will happen will take place
so first of all we have to know sambandha then we have to act in that relationship
so we know sambandha we have read oh yes i am part and parcel of god god is a creator
there are three modes of nature there is mind intelligence body we understand everything entire
mechanism but if you do not act in that relationship so there was one very pious man
he was our professor in college he was teaching a different branch
but very pious man a devotee also he helped us a lot after we
uh went to organize some programs in the college to organize it for us
and he had memorized entire bhagavad gita even we were not knowing all the shlokas
and we are brahmacharis in temple we have just begun to learn but then he is knowing all the
shlokas of bhagavad gita by heart and but then after some time he revealed that prabhu i am in
depression and i am feeling somebody will kill me something this will happen i am always scared
so we are just discussing just see what is the situation he's a pious man he's a devotee
and uh he is uh he has memorized he knows by heart all the shlokas of bhagavad gita
but just see he's having depression in his life he's having so much fear in his life
because he became very greedy he started his own college also he started many other things
and he accumulated so much money that money made him fearful so does this material assets which we
accumulate they simply increase fear of our heart rich man is always fearful oh he will take my money
he will take my money she will take my money a famous person is a person who has position he's
fearful indra is fearful oh he'll become next indra anybody does tapasya indra starts his asana start
shaking so we start shaking corporate oh somebody will take my position no i should not lose i
should work even harder student is afraid somebody may not take my rank my scholarship he's also
always fearful handsome husband wife is fearful my husband may not go away beautiful wife husband
is fearful somebody may not snatch my wife away so in this way material assets bring tremendous
fear to the heart so we have read mugged up entire bhagavad gita we are devoted to some level
but unless we have taken the process of abhidheya what is abhidheya that is called sadhana bhakti
spiritual master teaches us how methodically scientifically act in that relationship
with the absolute truth that is called sadhana
so that is why it is told
we may have some questions that i'm praying so much to krishna why krishna is not listening
krishna is not listening because we are not acting in that relationship
we will not be able to have realize any reciprocation from krishna we cannot see krishna we cannot
uh hear krishna's voice we cannot understand krishna's existence his personality
via our mundane mind and senses then what is the solution abhidheya you have to act in that
relationship that is called seva when the devotee becomes seven mukhe just see padma purana our
entire philosophy so strongly based on purana is nothing mentally concocted
when the living entity becomes service oriented and the service begins how
krishna's service begins with tongue chanting and tasting krishna prasadam
although it is a beginning although all our energies faculty should be used in the service
of krishna but beginning is very easy great discount is given just engage your tongue
and this is the secret when you control tongue all senses are engaged and controlled in krishna
service then what happens is automatically krishna manifests himself
so this realization is very very important
so there are various levels of knowledge first knowledge is called pratyaksha knowledge which is
third class shilaprabhupad calls it 10th class knowledge
pratyaksha means what i'm perceiving from my senses i take that as knowledge oh i am seeing
only then i will believe that is foolishness we don't see corona virus but it exists it has created
all calamity so that is called pratyaksha only i will see i will hear then i will put faith
then advanced second level of knowledge is paroksha what is paroksha which we hear from authorities
so this is more important because many things we do not see but we hear from authority from
disciplic succession guru parampara we have been told about vaikuntha a world which is always a
fulgent sun moon and not required their place where living entities do not die there is no disease
there is no fatigue there is no old age there is unlimited ever increasing enjoyment and krishna
lives there now we do not have experience but we hear of these things we hear of these things
i am soul within this body i do not have experience but we hear these things just
just like we hear there is virus in the body similarly experts they tell there is spirit
soul in the body so we hear that is called paroksha and when i realize this thing which
is third level that is very important that is called a paroksha so by hearing and following
acting in the relationship we start realizing this knowledge oh yes i am spirit soul oh yes
krishna is supreme person so we'll be thoroughly convinced yes pebbles and gold it is same for me
honor and dishonor is same we will realize this knowledge this is third level which is called
a paroksha so today's topic subject matter is how to develop spiritual vision
so that is called fourth level of knowledge spiritual vision is called adhokshaja
akshaja means a to z anything which can be perceived by senses which can be explained written in words
read in words but something which is indescribable using mundane words which is not perceivable by
our senses akshaja means knowledge which can be captured so that is called adhokshaja that is
called spiritual that is called next level of knowledge so when a first of all a person
realizes that yes krishna is supreme realization means thorough conviction
so when a person is thoroughly convinced logically thoroughly he'll be convinced yes i am not the
body and spirit soul krishna is supreme personality he will develop a very strong
conviction on all these truths not blind conviction but logics will be revealed when we engage in the
service of krishna we do seva and then when we continue following this process of seva
and how should we do seva prayosha is also very important third element of vedic knowledge
i should be very very anxious to develop taste that in the service of krishna to develop attraction
love for krishna i should be anxious to revive it unless objective is clear a person is going
to school without objective that i should score marks he will never score marks without objective
i should make profit a person is doing some business he will not make profit so objective
a person should be very anxious to attain it so when a person is very very eager to attain the
love of godhead then he will advance further and then he goes to adhokshaja then spiritual vision
develops and then spiritual life is no longer a theory spiritual life the description is given
dhru maharaj was there when he was about to leave his body then he was about to finish his worldly
pastimes a plane came from the vaikuntha with the spiritual personalities and he was able to see with
his eyes perceive and then he onboarded that plane so all these things become very very visible the
soul becomes visible spiritual world spiritual personalities they all become even in this material
world there are many personalities we are not able to see so dhru maharaj was able to perceive them
by one week of strongly following the sadhana which is spiritual master narad muni gave him
at least material existence he was able to see then slowly he was able to see
spiritual existence also so let me read that is actually very interesting purport
i'll share it with you
hariram hariram
so here it is mentioned
means most confidential mantra i'm giving you and you should do japa of it what is japa
japa means murmuring and so that just you can hear that sound
please hear that most confidential mantra from me
just chanting this mantra for seven nights
you will be able to see human beings who travel in space
so here this sankh yoga process which we are following that process is usually followed to
attain some siddhis there are eight kind of siddhis and one of the siddhis person becomes very light
he can fly in the space without any airplane so the vedas mentioned there is a planet called
siddhaloka where the people are born with all these ashta siddhis
so narad muni is telling now i am explaining to you this mantra if you chant this
then my by meditating upon the transcendental form of the lord and at the same time chanting the
mantra one becomes so perfect within seven days that he can see the human beings who fly in the
sky so even to perceive material world you need certain elevation in consciousness
so narad muni uses the word japa which indicates that the mantra to be chanted is very confidential
one may ask if it is confidential why it is mentioned in the writing of frimad bhagavatam
it is confidential in this sense pravapada explains one may receive a published mantra
anywhere but unless it is accepted through the chain of disciplic succession the mantra does not
act it is said by authoritative sources that any mantra chanted without having been received from
the disciplic succession has no efficacy that is called dwadaksh dwadashakshari mantra it is
mentioned in next shloka so unless it is received by the disciplic succession the mantra will not
act that is why taking deeksha initiation from spiritual master is very important spiritual
master gives this mantra to be worshipped by the disciple so then the real efficacy of the mantra
is revealed if you don't hear from parampara it will have no effect at all now how do we come to
this platform of realization we come to this adhokshaja knowledge that we also can perceive
parmatma krishna and the spiritual personalities and the spirit soul and even transcend that there
is another knowledge which is called aprakrit which is even beyond the understanding vision
of vakunthalokas that is the knowledge of krishna krishna consciousness of that of gola prindavan
so shloka gives in this way how we can attain dhruva maharaj was given a very tough process
another point established in this verse is that meditation should be carried on with the chanting
of a mantra so meditation without chanting was not recommended to dhruva maharaj do meditation with
chanting chanting of the hara krishna mantra is the easiest process of meditation in this age
as soon as one chants the hara krishna mantra he sees the forms of krishna rama and their energies
and that is a perfect stage of trance so here also in padma purana we are seeing
simply engage your tongue so simply by chanting the hara krishna mantra one sees krishna rama
and their energies and that is perfect stage of trance one should not artificially try to
see the form of the lord while chanting hara krishna as some of you who are new may do so
don't commit this mistake don't artificially try to envision oh i should see and chant no
but when the chanting is performed offenselessly what are the offenses please search on google
10 offenses against chanting i've explained previously the lord will automatically reveal
himself to the view of the chanter so when the chanting you are doing very nicely automatically
krishna will manifest in the heart the chanter therefore has to concentrate on hearing the
vibration and without extra endeavor on his part too i'm not able to see krishna i am chanting so
nicely for such a long time no extra endeavor is not required krishna is a person when chanting
is offenseless and the person is pleased lord will automatically appear what we have to do is very
simple process sound is falling on the ears just focus on the sound hara krishna hara krishna just
focus on the sound there's no need of putting any other endeavor any other complexities
just do the seva very very nicely and engage in chanting and hearing of this hara krishna
maha mantra and by this process very simple process of chanting hara krishna mantra without
offense just focusing on the sound vibration automatically krishna will appear within the
heart that is called spiritual vision and when the person is absorbed in this way
uh increasingly absorbed in krishna service initially there is some interruption in seeing
krishna within the heart and the veda has described very advanced levels that without
interruption sometimes sometimes only we think of krishna then we think of krishna most of the time
sometimes we forget and when without forgetting krishna we are able to constantly see krishna
within the heart and then when there is intense meditation on krishna within the heart then at
that platform we are able to understand see ourselves within this body we are able to
revive what is my relationship with supreme lord and i start acting in that relationship and that
thing is possible that thing begins by constant chanting of the holy names so throughout the day
we should be chanting if we are engaged in some other tasks whatever hearing we can do we should
do but our minimum rounds on beads you should be very very attentive hearing the mantra very nicely
simply by this process we will be able to develop spiritual vision
beyond this matter we will be able to see spirit supreme spirit krishna
vishnu first of all parmatma and then when a person devotee transcends with the process
which we are following that is direct process so beyond that we so to attain that stage we have to
follow this process very very nicely of sadhana bhakti to chant of his closely there are various
rules and regulations as a part of sadhana which are recommended we have to do every day without
fail in military discipline and then after that doing this sadhana very very nicely a person comes
to the point where spontaneously wants to serve krishna that is called raga bhakti on that platform
topmost knowledge aprakrit knowledge of krishna is revealed otherwise a person can only understand
knowledge up till vishnu so those who just follow rules and regulations very nicely but spontaneous
attachment for krishna has not been developed as such people they go to vaikunth loka they understand
only up to vishnu but when a devotee wants to serve krishna for no reason i want to serve because
i want to serve in such a manner then the devotee comes to the highest platform of aprakrit
understanding so krishna consciousness process is lord chatanya he came to take us to that level of
aprakrit understanding the highest spiritual vision so this is the process
we have to read bhagavad-gita as we are doing now we have to hear but we also have to act abhidheya
seva is very very important when we act in that relationship automatically krishna is revealed
in this way spiritual revelation is developed then our mind tongue ears eyes become completely
spiritual and when they are spiritual bc spiritual world spiritual things without any extraneous
