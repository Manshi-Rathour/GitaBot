We saw in the previous verse Lord Krishna is mentioning the first condition if you wish
to follow the eightfold mystic process of performing yoga which is very very tough.
It is even for even tougher Arjuna as Arjuna would express.
Then first of all you have to go to a sacred place sacred place Prabhupada mentioned in
the previous purport Haridwar, Rishikesh, Vrindavan, Jagannath Puri like this you have
to go and you have to sit firmly on an asana the asana should neither be too highly placed
nor too low there should be kusha grass on top of that there should be deer skin and
then a soft cloth over that you can sit and before that in the previous to previous verse
it was mentioned first of all you have to remain alone and you have to follow complete
tranquility of mind because continuously have to engage yourself in concentrating your
mind upon the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that is why you cannot sit in a place sit
in a home where you may be disturbed by various things.
So without any disturbance constantly 24 hours a person has to practice focusing upon the
form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart.
So now Lord Krishna is revealing revealing some further do's and don'ts which are those
let us see one should hold one's body neck and head erect
in straight line and stare steadily at the tip of the nose thus with an unagitated subdued
mind devoid of fear completely completely free from sex life one should meditate upon
me and make me the ultimate goal of life so very very important words instructions here
Lord Krishna is mentioning and the most important thing Srila Prabhupada begins with that in
the purport Srila Prabhupada explains the goal of life is to know Krishna who is situated
within the heart of every living being as Paramatma the four-handed form the four-handed
Vishnu form the yoga practice process is practiced in order to discover and see this localized
form of Vishnu and not for any other purpose the localized Vishnu murti is the plenary
representation of Krishna dwelling within one's heart one who has no program to realize
this Vishnu murti is uselessly engaged in mock yoga practice and is certainly wasting
his time Krishna is the ultimate goal of life and the Vishnu murti situated in one's heart
is the object of yoga practice so here it is being mentioned what is the ultimate goal
of this human form of life you are willing to do research about a piece of grass or some
small unicellular organism or some chemicals doing research about some chemicals some protons
or some subatomic particles it is not going to help us the goal of life is to know not any
particle not any grass any other species but to know Krishna because Krishna tells
all the from all the Vedas I am to be known Lord Krishna will explain further
and here also it is being mentioned that what is the purpose of yoga
so first of all many many things are clarified in this verse so many people they meditate on
something void zero as we would have seen in some yoga classes meditate upon they would tell some
air and or some energy centers in the body or outside the body or meditate in the space or on
some planet or on some organs of your body or so many things they would tell but they will not
tell what Lord Krishna is mentioning in the Bhagavad Gita here what is being mentioned
and Lord Krishna is telling some amkaya shirogrivam first of all sit erect you cannot be moving
and then some pressure nasikagram swam you have to see the tip of your nose
and many people and most of them they tend to completely close the eyes completely closing
the eyes is not recommended because a person will sleep off if a person sleeps off then the yoga
practice is disturbed so I should be half closed and if a person keeps eyes fully open then
obviously he will look here and there and he may get distracted mind should not be distracted at
all so that is why keep it half closed don't look anywhere no distraction whatever is moving static
you are not watching not interested and if you keep it completely closed you may sleep off so
keep it half closed and keep on staring at the tip of the nose so the vision is fixed here
and where is the mind fixed then Krishna is telling
the mind should be completely focused upon Krishna
mind should not be focused simply on some breath or some energy circle or some planet or xyz
mind should be focused on Krishna here it is mentioned we see in the Mahabharata shlokas also
the same thing is being mentioned so beautifully the form is mentioned of lord Krishna who is very
peaceful and he has got the hue of a rain cloud and he's lying on snake bed and he's
a padmanabham his lotus his navel is that of a is like that of a lotus flower or lotus flower
is coming out of his navel that is called padmanabham suresham he is the lord of all the
demigods like this after describing the form of the lord yogi ridhyaana gamya so yogis meditate
upon him ridhyaan in dhyana process what we are these rules and regulations are there for that
process yogis they pick up this process of dhyana yoga and meditate upon this form
so meditation on void is never recommended in that of patanjali yoga sutras or bhagavad gita
or bhagavatam or any other bona fide literature which describes the process of meditation
now because if everyone teaches the same thing why will people come to my shop
the authorized process of yoga has been taught for a long time so that is why people just to run
their own shop want to create a new process of yoga yin yoga chen yoga jin yoga power yoga and
astro yoga and so many yogas they have created because people think it is something new new
additions some interesting thing is there let me go and see otherwise if everybody preaches the same
thing as it is then a new person will have less scope because why should i go to him he's teaching
the same thing already i am connected to somebody my family is following somebody so their shop will
not run so that is why this great cheating is happening in the name of yoga so we should see
the instructions of lord krishna in the bhagavad gita many people they claim oh yes he is incarnation
of krishna every founder of spiritual organization he claims that he is incarnation of krishna
so many incarnations we have never so many incarnations have come like this
every founder of spiritual organization tells yes i am krishna i am god
but then said if you are god why you are not repeating the instructions of god
krishna did not speak to arjuna that imam vivasvati yogam millions of years ago i spoke
to vivasvan some knowledge then why am i speaking to you again because it is revised edition arjuna
few things i forgot to tell and my knowledge was imperfect so now my knowledge is perfect
and now therefore this revised edition is required no krishna is not telling
krishna is telling whatever i spoke to vivasvan the same thing i am going to speak to you again
similarly these instructions kapil muni has given to mother devahuti
he's also telling the same thing same old instructions i am going to speak to you now
without any change so if knowledge is perfect there is no need of any change
so if anybody is telling or if you are thinking that somebody is incarnation of god please read
bhagavad gita and tally the instructions there is no incarnation now incarnation is there
krishna is incarnated in the form of his holy name this is the incarnation current prevalent
which is manifest as sound which we are all chanting and serving him in this manner
another incarnation would be kalki incarnation all the incarnations are listed
when u.s president has to come to india everyone knows what he'll be doing everyone knows
how many minutes he'll be spending in which place everything is fixed
so krishna when he's coming here will it be very random event no everything is fixed in the
scriptures so that is why we should not fall for the cheating and even though we feel that
no by chance krishna has come in between so please tally the instructions with the bhagavad gita
the scriptures are standard knowledge knowledge cannot differ
so somebody approached pravapada and told pravapada he is also claimed as incarnation of rama and
krishna and he discussed about some very famous spiritual master so pravapada told usually pravapada
would be very very direct very very dissecting in his answers
but here pravapada was little mellowed and he told okay he may be but then i have the real
instructions of krishna here so why do you wish to take chance here i'm very sure this is krishna's
instruction then i may not be sure and if he's god then why his instructions are differing from
the instructions that are given here krishna is telling in bhagavad gita surrender only unto me
why he's telling that you surrender worship any devi devita as you wish as you desire
as there are opinions so many paths are there to attain supreme absoluter krishna is telling
only unto me and he's telling
even preachers of other religion they also know this thing so he's telling just see in
bhagavad gita it is written that do not worship other devatas why they are worshipping
so krishna is telling a person whose intelligence is lost because of material desires
intelligence is kidnapped stolen away
so this guru is telling you worship any devata some gurus give the mantra in the year oh which
devata do you worship this devata okay take this mantra only chant his name only so this is great
cheating it is not at all in confirmation with the instructions which are there in the scriptures
unfortunately nobody reads scripture that is why people are being cheated left and right
so here very very clearly it is told what is the object of meditation
and mine should be completely focused on krishna for what so that i can get some material powers
i can get a good job that is why i'm meditating meditating upon krishna no
i should be made the goal of life i am meditating upon krishna so that i can just engage myself in
the service of krishna krishna only is the goal of life i'm not meditating on krishna for some
ulterior purpose
people meditate upon their lovers not for their pleasure but for
for the lovers pleasure but for their own pleasure so this is not the mood of devotee
he is not meditating upon krishna just to derive some personal pleasure some personal benefit in
life he is meditating on krishna just for the pleasure of krishna
krishna should be made the goal of life so very clear instructions i should be half
close stare at the tip krishna should be made the aim of life
and mine should be completely subdued prashant atma prashant means completely unagitated
with a completely subdued mind completely unagitated mind if the mind is agitated
not subdued not tranquil then a person cannot find vishnu murti within the heart
and the thing which creates greatest disturbance in the mind agitation is
sex life therefore it is being mentioned here
to realize this vishnu murti within the heart one has to observe complete abstinence from sex life
therefore one has to leave home and live alone in a secluded place remaining seated as mentioned
above one cannot enjoy sex life daily at home or elsewhere and attend a so-called yoga class and
thus become a yogi so people do not teach this thing also that you have to follow strict brahmacharya
yes you have to live anywhere and you can become successful this is a very great cheating
brahmachari very clearly krishna is mentioned here
person should follow the vow with determination you should follow brahmacharya
so one has to practice controlling the mind and avoiding all kinds of sense gratification
of which sex life is the chief sex life is the main sense gratification
if there is no sex life this material world will not run on all these great buildings and
big big establishments stadiums and malls multiplex airports whatever we see it is all
because of this sex life sex energy pravapada was sitting once in new york and
and there was a very young sanyasi who has recently taken sanyas so pravapada asks him that
so new york women they are beautiful
and the sanyasi was confused what should i speak i am sanyasi i am not supposed to deal with women
why pravapada is asking like that so new york women are beautiful
then he could not answer he was dumbfounded so pravapada answered yes they are very beautiful
and all these men of new york they are after these women and that is why to impress them to
enjoy with them all these big buildings pravapada was sitting on the
rooftop of newly acquired temple which was pretty tall building it was in the manhattan skyline so
pravapada told all these big buildings you see that is because of this attraction
so therefore all this glamour all this glitter all this hard work it is only because of this sex
life if this is taken out then nothing can go on every other enjoyment material enjoyment is only
supplement to this central enjoyment so some people tell oh this sex life is actually
sorry brahmacharya is actually not controlling of sex life somebody shared with me the video
and he is becoming very famous in lockdown period another person has become
is becoming so-called guru and famous and he tells this brahmacharya means discussion about brahma
discussion about spiritual life brahmacharya does not mean stopping sex life this is nonsense
and where is the reference nowhere it is told in the scriptures that you have to
control sex life so brahmacharya what people discuss brahmacharya means
situation on the spiritual platform so yes he is correct brahmacharya means brahmacharati
eti brahmachari that is a definition that is why the students are called brahmachari they are taught
how to remain on the spiritual platform but a person can remain on the spiritual platform
only when he is completely regulated in a sex life so that is why so he tells tell me where in
which loka it is written in which scripture it is mentioned we only believe in scriptures
there's one thing actually what he preaches scriptures are perfect
and unfortunately people have no idea so did not answer it is mentioned
many many places and one such reference it is being given here the rules of celibacy the
definition is given by great sage yagya valkya very famous sage so yagya valkya says what is
brahmacharya
means it is said brahmacharya what is called brahmacharya brahmacharya
means actions means mind and means speech
means in all situations means at all times in all places at all times
means
in mind body actions and speech
always without any exception a person does not indulge in sexual affairs that is called brahmachari
at all times under law under all circumstances and in all places this is called brahmacharya very
very clear definition is given no one can perform correct yoga practice through sex indulgence
brahmacharya is taught therefore from childhood when one has no knowledge of sex life children
at the age of five are sent to the gurukul or the place of the spiritual master and the master
trains young boys in the strict discipline of becoming brahmacharis without such practice
no one can make advancement in any yoga be it dhyana yoga gyan yoga or bhakti yoga
so although the rules are being mentioned for ashtanga yoga here which is called dhyana yoga also
but a person cannot be successful in any yoga this brahmacharya is the foundation yes sitting
on asana laying kusha grass and putting deer skin going to jungle mountains this may not be
required for a bhakti yogi however this brahmacharya is very much required you follow dhyana gyan or
bhakti no one can make advancement in any yoga without this practice this nobody would teach
but then what about the householders how can they follow brahmacharya so it is being mentioned next
one who however follows the rules and regulations of married life
having sexual relationship only with his wife and that also under regulation is also called brahmacharya
so who follows the rules and regulations there are many many rules and regulations in married life
unrestricted enjoyment is never allowed just like unrestricted eating is not allowed to anybody
certain food items you can eat and that too after offering in a proper way
in regulated scheduled times in a similar fashion there are rules and regulations in married life
diti broke these rules and regulations they enjoyed sexual pleasure in the evening
and that is very very improper time that is why the great demons took birth
although kashyapmani was so powerful sage he was the father of all the devatas very pious souls
but because of not following these rules and regulations in the evening they enjoyed thus
these first demons of the universe they took birth
so if a person follows rules and regulations of married life having sexual relationship
only with his wife and that also under regulation there are other rules and regulations also
is also called brahmachari so he's also brahmachari such a restrained householder brahmachari
may be accepted in the bhakti school so the householders have got a discount they can also
be accepted in bhakti school but the gyan and dhyana schools do not admit even householder
brahmacharis they require complete abstinence without compromise
why so why these schools are the more advanced that they want complete first of all you take
and then we will talk about it and bhakti yoga is meant for the
less advanced people no it is the other way around in the bhakti school a householder brahmachari is
allowed control sex life because the cult of bhakti yoga is so powerful that one automatically loses
sexual attraction being engaged in the superior service of the lord how does it happen we have
seen in second chapter lord krishna mentions
whereas others are forced to restrain themselves from sense gratification
a devotee of the lord automatically refrains because of superior taste other than the devotee
no one has any information of that superior taste so the followers of gyan and dhyana schools have
no information of superior taste they just keep on avoiding the material objects which are tasty
in the beginning but produce unlimited miseries afterwards but in krishna consciousness the
devotee has access to superior taste because he experiences this superior taste automatically he
restrains himself from enjoying the inferior taste of sex life so thus a brahmachari householder is
given admission in the bhakti school because bhakti school is so powerful it introduces this
higher superior taste which is unfound in other schools of yoga but if a person wants to follow
the gyan or dhyana process which we are seeing here then a householder is not admitted person has
to leave house and then we will talk about spiritual advancement first of all come out
then another qualification
one cannot be fearless unless one is fully in krishna consciousness a conditioned soul is fearful
due to his perverted memories forgetfulness of his eternal relationship with krishna
so people are you know when we dream we get very very scared at times why we are scared because
we have forgotten that we are dreaming we don't know our permanent situation outside so in our
dream we are very very scared from any unwanted things this has not happened that has happened
some accident has happened some loss has happened all this is because of forgetfulness of our
actual position of wakefulness in a similar fashion unless somebody becomes completely
fully realized in krishna consciousness it is not possible to avoid this fear so that is why
fearlessness is possible perfectly possible for a devotee because a devotee perfect devotee
he is fully krishna conscious he knows his actual position i am eternal nobody can harm me and they
can only harm the body that and this body is also under krishna's protection krishna is situated in
everyone's heart and krishna is my father i am completely surrendered dependent on krishna
so krishna will do the best thing what is required for the body so the devotee is completely devoid
of all fear in such a manner therefore perfect practice is possible for a person who is krishna
conscious so this is very very important that is why the devotee is supposed to live in jungle
or the yogis are supposed to live in jungle they are supposed to live alone
and the devotees also earlier would live in jungles and just like haridas thakur and people
would go there to meet them now because people are not at all interested instead of going to places
such secluded places devotees are preaching and going everywhere living in the densely populated
cities otherwise just like haridas thakur he was living in a cave and in that cave a very big snake
also was living so can we imagine living in a cave which is very very dark and with a big snake
nobody can do that but a devotee can do that so just see this is the effect of devotional service
it can take us to such a platform of fearlessness that a person can share his room
or his cave with a snake without any fear so haridas thakur was chanting throughout the day
completely absorbed in meditation so what to speak of living with a snake he was meditating
completely oblivious of his cave mate but then some people they were requesting haridas thakur
that we want to have your darshan because this snake we cannot come you are very advanced and
fearless please help us so haridas thakur in order to favor the people he decided to move out and as
soon as he decided to move out parmatma sitting in the heart of the snake he instructed the snake
and the snake immediately left the place automatically so that is why taking sannyas is
very very important for spiritual life usually we think oh my boss is maintaining me he is giving
me salary or my family members are maintaining me if they are not there if i do not have son
daughter in old age who will take care of me what will happen and they do take care also at time so
we think oh just see they are taking care i am dependent on them or this government is so nice
government is taking care of me but when a person takes sannyas there is no governmental care there
is no child to take care of you son daughter nobody's around you don't have any friends
and you don't have money you don't have bank balance still a person gets his food a person
gets protection maintenance everything then his faith becomes very very strong upon krishna
that is why prabhupada would always tell that you please go out and take risks for krishna
without planning where would you sleep without planning where would you what would you eat
keep on traveling and preaching so prabhupada would encourage very much thus the devotees at
that time went to pakistan to preach at the time of india pakistan war they are anyway
they don't like to see the face of americans and that too america with american with a version of
the luck and people are showing them knife and they were threatening they would kill them they
would spit on their face and so much harassment but they went at the time of war to preach in pakistan
and they were going to vietnam to do book distribution vietnam was like iraq was
some time back and now syria and other places so vietnam was completely war-ridden and at that time
when some devotees were there and they told yes prabhupada we want to go to vietnam for
distributing books so devotees completely fearless and when he depends on krishna takes risks for
preaching krishna consciousness he develops a very strong faith in krishna so that is why
renunciation is very very recommended very much recommended
next
thus practicing control of the body mind and activities
the mystic transcendentalist attains to the kingdom of god by cessation of material existence
so by following brahmacharya when by making the mind completely fearless
by bringing tranquility complete control over the mind by meditating upon lord krishna within
the heart keeping him as the aim what ultimately has to be attained so krishna should be the goal
of life but people do not understand when we tell krishna is the goal of life krishna's goal means
life krishna's goal means what our goal is to have some bank balance and meet some person or
marry some person or have an establishment business that is clear goal is krishna means
what are we supposed to do with krishna so very clearly it is mentioned here in this verse
thus practicing control
controlling body mind and activities
means liberation paramami supreme liberation so there are various kinds of liberation but a yogi
is supposed to attain the supreme liberation by following these practices which lord krishna has
told go to secluded place sit with spine erect meditate on the tip of your nose fearlessness
brahmachari and meditate upon krishna within the heart may krishna the goal of life by this
supreme liberation will be attained and what is that supreme liberation means establishment
kingdom of god so just like we have cities we have planets god also has got
a dwelling a place an abode and that is called vaikuntha so we want to go to a more comfortable
and better place oh this city is not good let me go to new york american cities though european
cities those cities are very very good so even if you go to those cities disease old age death
stress all these things they persist but there is a place if we go there we become
completely comfortable and not just comfortable we become ecstatic just like a fish when put
into water become satisfied as soon as the soul is transferred to a completely spiritual atmosphere
without any tinge of matter the soul becomes completely satisfied much so there is establishment
there are places there are buildings but those are completely made up of spiritual substance
a person attains to that spiritual world and this is also mentioned in the other places that is why
krishna tells i am speaking to you the most confidential knowledge very secret knowledge
we cannot even measure the limits of the universe when you go outside the limits of the universe
krishna tells whatever is manifest whatever is unmanifest beyond that if you
reach then you'll find another place and that is my abode there i live and what is the nature
of that place illumination is not required by sun and the moon here we have only one sun which is
self-illuminated other planets they are dark they are effulgent they are illuminated because
of the effulgence of sun but just like there is one effulgent sun here in spiritual world every
planet is completely effulgent so sun and moon are separately not required for illumination over
there sun and moon are not required all the planets they produce light all the bodies
they are effulgent they produce light over there that is dham again the word dham is used
so krishna is not telling i am some energy come and sit in me and merge in me you and me are the
same this is never mentioned krishna is telling i am there living in that place you also please
come and live with me i have a dham vrindavan dham and shanti dham dham means place abode
so you also come and live with me so this is the ultimate goal of yoga which is very very
clearly mentioned an advanced yogi can control his breath our breathing cycles are fixed
so he gains such an amazing control on breath that whenever he wishes he can finish his breathing
cycles so why does he wish to remain long here because he wants to make sure that i am completely
concentrated on my destination so the description of various planets are given just like you find
description or if you go to america american cities are so nice like that or if you go to
this institute this institute is so nice like that so many facilities such good placement you
should take admission and then person starts working hard by hearing about that institute
even though he has not seen but in the counseling he will choose that institute i i want this thing
there are all facilities over there in this place in a similar fashion the descriptions are given
in the vedas of various planets and the yogis by hearing those descriptions they meditate on that
and when they are completely fixed at the time of leaving the body they will go straight to that
planet so advanced yogis they can decide on which planet i want to transfer my soul to from
brahmarandra elevating the soul here from brahmarandra top of head the soul leaves
and it goes to a different planet now they are willing to go to mars and some other planets
that is not possible by current science and some people by advanced sciences like bali maraj he
reached other higher planets but if you wish to stay on that planet you need to have qualification
any government office but he cannot be allowed to sit in that office and run on the things
you need qualification clear some exams to sit in that office the government establishment agencies
will come police will come they will be thrown out so first of all we cannot reach because all
the dham they are meant for suitable personalities who are qualified to live there even though you
meet each other planets you will be thrown out establishing yourself without following the proper
process is not possible so perfect yogi who is not at all attracted by any material planets
he knows the description of spiritual world completely focuses on spiritual world
and when he's fixed upon the spiritual world within the heart and then he finishes his breathing
cycles and he can go must some time he attains my establishment my kingdom
so
when people tell you have to merge you have to do this thing and that thing that is not
corroborated in the bhagavad-gita the perfection of dhyana yoga also is must
going back to the kingdom of god
so please read this purport it is also very important because of limited time we cannot
discuss it in detail now very very important thing which we usually skip
because we are conditioned by this body we are not liberated it is very very important to keep
this body in purified state that is why lord krishna is mentioning now
there is no possibility of once becoming a yogi yes prabhu i have learned everything i will sit
erect now like this and i will keep on staring at the tip of the nose and i am following brahmacharya
also and with great difficulty somehow i am successful and so i will perfect my yoga now no
further krishna is mentioning there is no possibility of once becoming a yogi i am sitting
with my chanting beads very nicely i will hear with great attention no if one eats too much
or eats too little sleeps too much or does not sleep enough
so regulation in diet regulation in sleep is very important
so some people are very fond of eating they eat various food stuffs
regulation of diet and sleep is recommended herein for the yogis too much eating means eating more
than is required to keep the body and soul together so any eating which is not required to
keep the body and soul together that is called overeating
or if one eats too little so this eating also has to be minimized but how to regulate how to
minimize it some fasting days are given you fast on the appearance day of krishna or his expansions
incarnations and that too there is regulation at this time you have to break the fast that is also
compulsory after ekadashi breaking fast is also compulsory you cannot fast continuously for two
days ekadashi and next there are some continuous days of fasting so midnight fast has to be broken
by non-grains or some fruits so various rules and regulations are there for fasting and breaking
the fast so if a person does not break the fast properly then also that is improper somebody
fasts on whimsical days oh i do monday fasting i do tuesday fasting wednesday thursday friday
any other day fasting i fast on this date of the month i fast on my birthday or xyz
so that is also not recommended so that will degrade one in yoga so that is why fasting also
is a science and the details are given when to fast how to fast how much to fast sometimes eating
is compulsory sometimes fasting is very important so eating too little if a person needs too much
very voraciously he will get diabetes and if a person eats very less he'll get tuberculosis
medically also so that is why in a similar fashion there is spiritual impact also eating too much
eating too little should not be done when to eat how much to eat regulation that is important
similarly sleeping sleeping too much more than required for keeping body soul together
that is an impediment sleeping too less oh i will not sleep become goswami
then that is also an impediment in yoga so regulation is very very important word
in yoga person who is not balanced who is not regulated in his life he cannot become a yogi
and such is the next verse also
so
so some people ask that prabhu many times we are not you are not covering the theme we speak of
some other things and the theme is less covered only sometimes it is completely covered in the
lecture why is it so so it is because we are not covering themes we are studying here bhagavad
gita systematically entire bhagavad gita so however there is something which is important
so that is mentioned or few of the important things are mentioned as the title of the session
but we are not studying themes we are studying entire bhagavad gita so every shloka conveys
some other thing so i cannot put learn brahmacharya also and learn regulation and eating and diet also
and balance yama niyam also learn what is the ultimate aim of life also so all these things
cannot be mentioned so that is why thematic sessions are different that also we have covered
in jaygyasa in those particular things whatever shlokas from bhagavad gita were there we had
discussed now here because we are covering systematically so sometimes we have to bear
and we have to discuss some other times which may not be related to theme but with the shlokas are
conveying so yukta hara viharasya yukta cheshtasya karmasu yukta sapnava bodhastya yoga bhavati dukkha
so today i will share with you one secret secret of self-realization
so people ask various questions how to a self-realization yes this yoga sankhya yoga
is not possible now arjuna is going to reject it and from karma yoga also we have to move on
to bhakti yoga gyan yoga is not possible so how do we exactly execute this bhakti yoga exactly
execute spiritual life so that we can have self-realization today so this shri prabhupada mentions
in shreemad bhagavatam first canto third chapter verse number 44 in the purport
shri prabhupada mentions one should hear with rapt attention from the real person
so please hear carefully one should hear with rapt attention from the real person so three things
are used one should hear hear from whom from a real person and how one should hear with rapt
attention and then he can at once realize the presence of lord krishna in every page
so such a person will be able to realize the presence of lord krishna in every page
of bhagavatam the secret of knowing bhagavatam is mentioned here so this is a secret many people
read bhagavatam but are not able to know or realize bhagavatam so what is the secret of knowing
bhagavatam that is mentioned here hearing with rapt attention from the right person
now how to give this rapt attention further prabhupada is explaining no one can give rapt
attention who is not pure in mind so purity in mind is very much required for rapt attention
no one can be pure in mind who is not pure in action how does purity in mind come what is
purity of mind what is purity and what is impurity so in chemical composition we define
purity as some carbon dioxides monoxides nitrous oxides and so many other gases which are there
so these are called impurities what is purity oxygen if there is more oxygen that that is
considered more pure in a similar fashion on the level of energies rajaguna and tamuguna rajasic
tamasic are impure energies and sattvic energy is pure energy so purity of mind means mind is
in sattvaguna so when the mind is pure then a person can give rapt attention rajasic mind
and tamasic mind they are disturbed and lazy and very very dull so mind should be pure means mind
should be sattvic and how mind is rendered pure no one can give rapt attention who is not pure in
mind no one can be pure in mind who is not pure in action mind becomes pure sattvic by pure or
sattvic actions no one can be pure in action who is not pure in eating sleeping fearing and mating
now how to do pure activities what are the activities are four main activities
ahar nidra bhaen and methun there is a some substance of human activities here
or animal activities also but animals cannot do it purely so no one can be pure in action who is
not pure in eating sleeping fearing and mating but somehow or other if someone hears with rapt
attention from the right person at the very beginning one can assuredly see lord krishna
in person in the pages of bhagavatam and then sri pravapada explains this rapt attention takes
many many lives like pralad maraj and he was so much wrapped in attention to krishna even he
would take poison poison would change its nature and would become nectar you put him in boiling oil
boiling oil will not be able to affect his body this is the effect of very advanced stage of
absorption such rapt attention however is not it is a result of many many births of strong tapasya
in bhakti over however somehow or the other if a person is able to give rapt attention then he
can realize lord krishna this is a secret of realizing lord krishna hearing from the right
source with rapt attention so rapt attention nobody can have if he is not pure in mind mind
should be free from rajas and tamas rajas and tamas means lust and greed desire to have anything
more than which is required for keeping body and soul together and lust means enjoying more
than necessary you have to eat some food to maintain this body that enjoyment is okay there
would be some taste in food but more if you want to have more than the maintenance that is not
allowed so purity in action so purity in action means purity in ahar purity in sleeping and purity
in ah nidra bhai and met on purity in defense and purity in sex life so that is what lord krishna
is mentioning in this verse the same thing nobody can become yogi unless he is pure he is regulated
in ahar vihar cheshta and uh dream or sleep a person who is regulated in these activities
he can mitigate dukkha we want to become free from all the miseries that is not possible by
planning a new job planning new family or planning a new place of residence or purchasing
some object of sense enjoyment no dukkha mitigation of material misery is possible when
a person practices yoga by following these regulations so apart from following the positive
principles of doing our sadhana reading chanting every day we have to follow this regulation
unless somebody is regulated in life yoga practice will not be successful it will be successful will
take a very very long time so if we do it with regulation pravapattu just like a wet wood is
there wet wood if you put to water if you put into fire it will take time first of all it has to
become dry and then it would be ignited again again we keep on wetting it but if fire is there that
water is going away it will take a long time but if dry wood is there you put in fire immediately
it catches fire ignited similarly if we keep ourselves dry then as soon as we come in contact
with krishna immediately there is spiritual surcharge there is spiritual advancement so we
have to maintain purity in ahar vihar work and sleep so what is purity in sleep we should sleep
not more than six hours in a day and if required one hour in the daytime we can sleep in the night
time we should sleep early and we should get up in the brahmohurta before sunrise so in that way
we can calculate so if we have to get up in brahmohurta reduce six hours at that time you
sleep so nine to three nine thirty to three thirty or ten to four in this manner we can sleep and if
required then one hour in the daytime not more than one hour if you sleep more in the daytime that
brings down our health that pulls us into tamoguna and creates all spiritual and material
miseries makes us very very lazy head would be very heavy and we'll become tamasic so this is how
we should be able to regulate our sleep sleep at fixed time and not that i will sleep six hours at
the daytime no sleep six hours at the night time and in the brahmohurta we should be getting up
and in the daytime we can take rest a small nap maximum of one hour if required in this way we
should regulate our sleep and the work also should be regulated work should also be pure what is
meant by pure work work can be done in sattvaguna rajaguna and tamoguna tamasic works means
destructive work physical work which will bring only destruction in life and rajasic work means
work which a person does for sense gratification tamasic work is done for destruction of others
and brings in his own ruination also rajasic work means sense enjoyment
this what kind of work disturbs the mind so work should be done sattvic in nature work should be
done only to keep the body and soul together and a person should not be attached to the results of
his work and the work should be done suyantrita pravopada mentioned just like a watch is there
so that is why we have this morning program work should not be done as per what i feel to do
work should be done as per the schedule you make a schedule an entire day we should be doing
we should try to stick to that schedule very very nicely so this is called sattvic work we are doing
the work as if we are obliged to do that work if you are doing the work because i want to do it
then you are getting carried away by rajaguna and tamoguna that is impurity in action so the action
work should be sattvic regulated way chat chart out the activities of the entire day with the
help of devotees and then try to stick to those activities and for what for sense gratification
no the work should be done simply to maintain the body and soul together so maximum eight
hours of work is required is allowed because it is ideal people are we all of us are very greedy
here so greed may not come to zero immediately that is why up to eight hours you can put more
than that if you put also in your work you will not get any more than you are destined to get
so maximum eight hours and then the person advances he reduces his work and spends more
time in the service of krishna and we should not be attached to the results of the work also
the result of the work is also offered to krishna and
ahar ahar means eating also should be sattvic fruits grains vegetables so these are milk
sugar these are sattvic things so sattvic diet can be taken and the sattvic diet also should
be regulated at scheduled times of the day we can take and it is given that the diet of a
spiritualist should be 50 25 25 50 percent can be solid 25 percent can be liquid
we can take water also along with the meals and so whatever you are telling whatever we are taking
either it is water or some other fluid it should be 25 percent of the diet and 25 percent should be
left empty for air circulation for proper digestion so suppose we are getting full by eating eight
chapatis so then you take less 50 percent four chapatis i will take and 25 percent accordingly
liquid and 25 percent should be empty in this way we should try to stick to regulated times
and then if a person is able to have regulated food like this there is no need of doing asanas
and all other so many rigorous things so all these are meant for people who cannot digest their food
properly so anybody tells if he's having regulation in his life then the health would be very very good
and the devotee automatically follows all these principles as prabhupada would explain in the
purport because the devotee always eats krishna prasadam so there is no question of eating
rajasik tamasik all such food stuffs satvik food stuffs only krishna wants so automatically this
pure food is maintained and even though a person is having satvik if it is not offered to krishna
then that is sinful because so much killing is involved even in vegetarian diet
so therefore regulated food means first of all the quantity it should be offered to krishna
and then the quantity also should be controlled and the person should take at scheduled times
vihar means recreation or enjoyment so devotee's enjoyment is very very simple
a devotee vihar also means sexual pleasure so a devotee produces children by following the rules
and regulations chanting and up to 50 rounds and all other rules for production of a krishna
conscious child so that is why automatically his sensual pleasures are also regulated
and yukta cheshtasya karmasu devotee is always absorbed in the service of krishna
so his work is automatically regulated those who are not engaged in service of krishna yes they
have to measure oh i should do a very peaceful work which suits my mind and body i should give
up the results of my activities i should not be attached but devotee whatever work he is doing
he is doing for krishna so it is regulated and devotee does not there is no need of artificially
restraining the sleep the devotee anyway he always wants to remain engaged in the service
of krishna so whenever he has to sleep he feels very embarrassed oh now i am conditioned by this
body this body cannot 24 hours work for krishna so i have to give rest so the sleep of the devotee
automatically is minimized so in this way if you follow devotional service all these principles
are followed but nevertheless we have to follow these principles even though it is not coming
automatically by strong attachment to krishna so please focus on these things take prasadam as
much as possible and if not entire meals at least start with something that you can have at least
one meal of prasadam in a day and your work should be regulated plan your schedule your day
in a very nice manner take out time for sadhana take out time for your work if you're working
very very hard try to restrict your work hours not more than eight hours we should put in our work
sleeping if you are doing more and without any regulation try to get up in the brahmurta take
six hours of rest a night and one of rest in the daytime in this way by following these rules and
regulations all the material miseries can be mitigated simply if a person is regulated in
his actions in his thoughts in his speech automatically there won't be any material
misery to that person and if we are extravagant not regulated then even though we are trying to
chant trying to do other things will be affected by material miseries so please keep these do's
and don'ts in mind so the do's and don'ts are almost over here next we'll move on with the
next instructions as lord krishna explains
so now i request we have crossed a few extra minutes today so let us now chant this very very
easy process of controlling all the senses and this process is so powerful even though a person
may not be able to follow all these rules and regulations simply if he starts with this one
regulation that is chanting of the names of krishna he will get strength he will get proper
direction to follow all these rules and regulations automatically need not get
worried that oh nobody can make advancement in any process without following brahmacharya even
in bhakti yoga that is a fact but in bhakti yoga you need not wait to become perfect brahmachari
simply we keep on chanting and hearing and such strength will automatically develop
to householders to those who are single to everybody so let us start this most powerful
process but this is very important what we discussed realization happens by hearing with
rapt attention you need not understand the what is this mantra what is the science of
mantra even what is the meaning of mantra and that is why prabhupada would
when he was in india prabhupada was giving classes in other language and the disciples got up and
they started moving prabhupada started speaking hindi so prabhupada immediately made them sit
time speaking for you all you don't realize how do you have spiritual realization so spiritual
realization it's not an intellectual process it happens by hearing with rapt attention
so prabhupada was so particular even though class is happening bhagavatam is being discussed in a
different language you sit and hear with rapt attention so this is the mysticism of the
spiritual sound so just try to hear with rapt attention this are krishna maha mantra
and we'll chant 21 times and post that we will discuss any questions if anybody has so please
