In the previous session, we understood the definition of Sankhya Yoga, what is the meaning
of Sankhya, what is the meaning of Yoga and how this term can often get confused because
in different circumstances it has got different meanings.
So to reiterate Sankhya means analysis.
So when we try to understand this world analytically that is called Sankhya Yoga.
So by analysis just like we discussed when you try to enjoy the senses it is like itching
sensation you are trying to satisfy it by scratching your wound but what happens the
itching sensation only increases you are never satisfied by scratching so this is called
logic analysis oh yes this is right and in this way a person tries to control the senses
and advance in spiritual life this is called analytical analytical way of spiritual advancement
and there is another way of getting knowledge and what is that simply if a person engages
himself in the service of Krishna without any analysis all this knowledge will automatically
be revealed in the heart how he is not the body how material enjoyment he will not find
any taste no satisfaction all these purports will be revealed by Krishna from the heart
simply a devotee has to engage in chanting about Krishna's name hearing Krishna's name
quality form pastimes thinking of him or contemplating upon the philosophy offering prayers worshipping
the deities serving the lotus feet so in this way this is called bhakti yoga directly engaging
the senses in the service of Krishna and then Krishna reveals all the knowledge from
the heart however it is very very difficult to perform such bhakti yoga because people
are not so elevated to understand the science that I am part and parcel of God by engaging
in the service of God I will be satisfied so that is why these gradual processes are
recommended so for those who cannot understand this thing first step is start giving up the
results of your activity and then you will develop some sanity so that you can understand
analysis at least otherwise those who are grossly after material enjoyment either they
don't understand the analysis at all in the first place or even if they understand they
are not able to control their senses so first of all the recommendation for them is you
start giving up the results of your activity then you will understand analysis Sankhya
then you will be able to meditate when you have given up your possessions proprietorship
and you are logically convinced by Sankhya and then you can understand the importance
of yoga you try to connect yourself with the supreme and once the connection is established
the devotee develops attraction then the knowledge is revealed about the personality of Godhead
then he engages himself in bhakti yoga so in Lord Krishna has been mentioning all these
yogas but we see here and there he puts bhakti yoga somewhere he's mentioning karma yoga control
the senses but in the second chapter where Krishna is giving basic instructions just try to control
the senses and nothing else but then Krishna has given one shloka there also in the analysis how
you are different from senses and body Krishna tells Sarvani Tani Sarvani Sanyamya one who
controls all the senses how he controls in my service the senses are to be engaged this
is called bhakti yoga so Krishna is willing to give bhakti yoga from the very beginning
but Arjuna is representing himself as a layman a layman cannot take directly to bhakti yoga
Krishna consciousness so although Krishna is willing to impart and thus we find wherever any
shloka is there about other kinds of yoga Krishna is putting some hints of bhakti yoga but directly
it is not been mentioned because Arjuna can misunderstand it or a layman like us for whom
Bhagavad-gita is spoken we can misunderstand it so that is why Krishna is not able to reveal the
most confidential knowledge which Krishna reveals later as we will see it so now although Krishna
is building up to the point of Sankhya yoga again Krishna we will see he is putting up the
elements of bhakti yoga also here and there which is the topmost thing so there is a meaning of
Sankhya analysis of the material elements and by analysis you try to understand your spiritual
position and try to advance further towards your topmost bhakti yoga system so which are
the verses that mark the beginning of this chapter let us see now
yes verse number one
so at the end of previous chapter after explaining the importance of analysis explaining the
importance of renunciation a person who is wise he has no duties to perform who is self-satisfied
he has no duties to perform again Krishna told Arjuna you fight so Arjuna is confused what I am
supposed to do I am supposed to take sannyas renounce everything or I am supposed to do yoga
what I am supposed to do please explain sometimes you tell you leave everything and then you are
telling you do yoga you do karma yoga so Lord Krishna is clarifying his doubt in this shloka
translation is the blessed Lord said one who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works
obligated is in the renounced order of life and he is the true mystic not he who lights no fire
and performs no work so Lord Krishna is giving here the definition of sannyas Arjuna is thinking
as many others may also think sannyas and yoga are two different things but here Krishna is
telling who is actually sannyasi so you can read these lines anashritaha karma phalam karma phalam
means the result of your activities anashrita means without shelter he is not working to get
the results of his activities then why does he work karyam karma karoti karyam means he's
obligatory work he's obliged to do it somebody tells you you stand here and guard this house
not that you are getting great pleasure in doing that but it is the duty so I am doing that so if
up so that is why now why we are working all of us very very hard because we want the results of
activities so we cannot be called yogis people tell oh I am karma yogi I believe in karma yoga
so sir you believe in karma yoga so it means you are not interested in whatever money you will make
from this business in whatever name fame power you will develop from this business if actually
you are not interested in any of the name fame or prosperity then I then yes that is called karma
yoga otherwise it is not karma yoga it is simply karma anashrita karma phalam a person does not
want the result of the activity but he is doing as if he's obliged to do that activity sannyasi
cha yogi cha na niragne na chakriya one who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works
as he's obligated is in the renounced order of life and he is the true mistake he's sannyasi as
well as he's yogi not he who lights no fire and performs no work the Sheila Prabhupada explains
in the purport in this chapter the Lord explains that the process of eightfold yoga system is a
means to control the mind and senses so all the instructions Krishna has given Arjuna please
control the mind and senses and even one of the senses if they are let loose mind focuses
on any of any one of the wandering senses it can topple a person's spiritual life spiritual
and material also a person with unregulated senses cannot have any satisfaction in life
Shrimad Bhagavata mentions Hiranyakashipu was having control of all the universe he removed
all the ministers which are called devata they control the elements like fire water and other
things and he directly took in charge of all these elements however he was dissatisfied so
Bhagavata mentions whatever is meant whatever is there in the entirety of the universe cannot
satisfy a person whose senses are not controlled so if a person's senses are not controlled what
to speak of spiritual advancement materially also if he acquires everything entirety of whatever is
available in the entire universe for sense enjoyment a person whose senses are not controlled he will
never be satisfied so when Krishna explained this thing to Arjuna and now what is the solution how
to control the mind and senses it is difficult so Krishna is explaining now see Arjuna this is
the way to control mind and senses and Krishna will explain all the details here in this chapter
however although we will see that Krishna is mentioning these things of Sankh Yoga to Arjuna
but such kind of meditation is very difficult for the people in general to perform especially
so although the eightfold yoga system is recommended in this chapter the Lord emphasizes that the
process of karma yoga or acting in Krishna consciousness is better that is why we see Arjuna
what to speak of people of Kali Yuga who are so disturbed and poor in their physical and
mental strength but Arjuna who was such a strong person physically mentally spiritually he told
Sankh Yoga this ashtanga this process I cannot do so Krishna then we will see at the end of the
chapter he's telling don't worry you're already on the topmost platform of yoga system so here
Prabhupada mentions a very important point which I have highlighted so Lord is emphasizing that
although he's mentioning that this is the process for controlling mind and senses however if a
person is intelligent then he can take up to the process of karma yoga which is easy which
everybody can perform rather than taking this very difficult thing so everyone acts in this
material world to maintain his family and their paraphernalia but no one is working without some
self-interest some personal gratification be it concentrated or extended the criteria of perfection
is to act in Krishna consciousness and not with a view to enjoying the fruits of work to act in
Krishna consciousness is the duty of every living entity because all are constitutionally parts and
parcels of the supreme the parts of the body work for the satisfaction of the whole body the limbs
of the body do not act for self-satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the complete whole similarly
the living entity who acts for satisfaction of the supreme whole and not for personal satisfaction
is the perfect sannyasi the perfect yogi so this is the catch why the whole world is dissatisfied
they are working very very hard they are dissatisfied because they do not know the
science somebody seeing that this leaf is drying up and they want to put water directly on the
leaf so it is foolishness because the person does not know the science how the leaf has to be
satisfied if you want to satisfy the leaf don't put water on the leaf directly put water on the
roots of the tree in a similar fashion what is our science the science is that we as a spirit soul
are part and parcel we are always connected to Krishna Krishna is the center of all the soul
spread throughout the universe in various planets so unless we satisfy Krishna it is
not at all possible to get satisfaction in life so everyone in this world is acting to
maintain his family and other connected things paraphernalia but everyone is working for self
self-interest means a person can try to directly satisfy his senses or try to satisfy the senses
of his family members or that of his society or that of nation but ultimately it is called
sense gratification only it is not called any benevolent service people think if I am trying
to satisfy work for the satisfaction of entire society or entire nation I am very great man no
sir this is ignorance if a person think the social worker is a great man then he is a foolish
man as per the absolute truth oh social worker is foolish foolish yes why he's foolish because
isha vasya idam sarvam because the person does not have basic sense that God is a
supreme proprietor he is a supreme creator so God has created this entire world for the
satisfaction of all the jivas all the living entities who are here just like the government
has got various resources and if a person steals the Reserve Bank of India for his personal needs
or he steals for the family or he steals for entire society or state that person would be
called a thief we cannot hello you are stolen for your entire family you are very nice person
man oh you stole for entire society the entire state that is very great act no that understanding
is because we are not the proprietors therefore the act remains that of stealing and thus anybody
who is not working for the satisfaction of Krishna he is working for self-interest self-interest
could be personally related to my mind and body or expanded because I consider them also as
my family members are my extended selves they belong to me or my the people of my nation they
belong to me I'll work for the benefit of people and I will kill animals because I think animals
do not belong to me so this is also self-interest so as long as a person is working for self-interest
there is no question of having satisfaction in life that is why the great leaders the people who
do a lot of charity they are also dissatisfied in their life what to speak of ordinary people
Vedavyaas he had complete knowledge he mentioned all the Puranas worship of all the devis devitas
giving charity maintaining a very strict moral life he gave all these codes all the wonderful
knowledge but he also were distressed dissatisfied in his life the Narad Muni spiritual master came
and he told why you are dissatisfied because you have not mentioned directly the activities
the pastimes and science of the supreme personality of Godhead and then came out
Shrimad Bhagavatam the final composition of Vedavyaas even after writing Vedanta sutra
people give a lot of stress about on Vedanta so Vedanta also will not satisfy you unless you
understand the proper explanation or commentary on Vedanta sutra that is
Shrimad Bhagavatam so that is why in our life also unless we directly hear the pastimes of God
even Bhagavad Gita is not sufficient Narad Muni told because people will not misunderstand it
small portion you have mentioned in the Mahabharata that is also not sufficient unless you directly
hear the pastimes of God and explain the pastimes of God discuss it with others engage directly in
the service of God there is no question of satisfaction you keep on reading all the
Upanishads you keep on reading all the Vedas all the Samhitas everything but satisfaction is not
there because the science is I am part and parcel of Krishna it is very simple just like even though
there is some problem in the eye the medicine goes to the stomach and that automatically improves the
disorders of the entire body we have to we have to put food in the stomach
in a similar fashion it is very very simple act so just like there is a pastime one devotee shared
Srila Prabhupada was discussing so I saw that one of my godbrothers it was very hot
and suddenly started fanning Guru Maharaj Bhakti Sadan Maharaj so Bhakti Sadan Maharaj told why you
are fanning me suddenly so that Prabhupada's godbrother means another disciple of Bhakti Sadan
Maharaj he told because our satisfaction lies in satisfying your good self
so this is the science this is the secret of satisfaction satisfaction of Krishna or his
representative when a person engages in such a manner then only he feels unlimited satisfaction
in his life otherwise working for my self enjoyment or extended self enjoyment it is
not going to satisfy anybody so this thing people miss in life always everyone is planning oh so now
tomorrow what should I eat what should I purchase what should I order what should I cook so that I
am satisfied nobody is thinking oh this is winter season this fruit has come let me make something
nicely for Krishna from this fruit and feed him oh let me Krishna has not eaten this thing for
many days let me cook this thing for Krishna and then you take that prasadam then you will
be satisfied oh it is very hot let me put ac in my room but Krishna we are not putting anything
so we are not thinking like that so when we are always thinking when I am having some trouble in
my body then I am thinking how to satisfy myself or let me go and purchase this medicine and let
me have some money so that in future if some difficulty happens I should not suffer from this
but if a devotee thinks oh I am having so much suffering similarly all the living entities are
having this suffering how all the living entities they are in this troublesome situation in this
body so as soon as a devotee suffers he immediately thinks oh everybody is suffering like this so I
should help them I should try to spread Krishna consciousness satisfy Krishna so in this way when
a person is always thinking of satisfying Krishna then there is satisfaction in life so we also can
implement this in our life and see the result so Prabhupada tells that is why our principle is
every single moment of the day we should see that we are always trying to engage ourselves in the
satisfaction of Krishna wholeheartedly and this is where the intermediate platform of devotional
service starts that is called madhyamadhikari madhyamadhikari means avyarth kalatvami sees even
one moment is not wasted without serving Krishna moment to moment he is conscious he is anxious so
I should engage in satisfying Krishna satisfying Krishna so it is not easy to work on this platform
however we should strive to attain it if that much realization is not there that we can engage
ourselves every moment in Krishna's service then few moments you take out work as a matter of
regulation okay so four hours in a day chanting reading some book distribution some seva I will do
or one hour in a day or at least half an hour in a day or few minutes in a day at least to begin
with let me try to just please Krishna let me just chant and hear the holy name for the
satisfaction of Krishna so this chanting which we are doing it is for satisfying Krishna Krishna's
incarnation in the form of name so when we are working in this understanding then we see
automatically there is pleasure in our life so this is the science of Krishna consciousness
so the sanyasi sometimes artificially think that they have become liberated from all material duties
and therefore they cease to perform the Agnihotra yajnas but actually they are self-interested
because their goal is becoming one with the impersonal Brahm so sanyasi is usually when a
person takes sanyas it is not easy to understand Krishna consciousness but at least it is easy to
but at least it is easy to understand material activities are entangling and frustrating never
satisfying so at least you leave that is called renunciation but there is not real renunciation
as per Krishna's definition in this verse Krishna is defining any person who is working as if he's
obliged to do the work and he is not having any desire to enjoy the results of that work
he's called a sanyasi so sometimes some sanyasis who have renounced this material world so
ordinarily when a person is not a renouncer he's supposed to do Agnihotra yajna fire sacrifice
for satisfaction of Krishna and various devatas various living entities yajna sacrifice is very
very important just like we sacrifice some of our money as form of in the form of tax similarly we
are supposed to sacrifice our resources as yajnas for the satisfaction of Krishna all the householders
are supposed to do five kinds of yajnas every panchusu yajna they are five kinds of sinful
activities to counter that a person is supposed to do this yajna every day so when you take sanyas
sanyas means situated on the platform of knowledge then you no longer obliged to do these yajnas
so some sanyasis they give up these yajnas and they think oh i am now a sanyasi but prabhupada
is telling here and Krishna is also explaining through this verse they are not actually sanyasis
because they are also self-interested what is the self-interest of sanyasi
when a person begins his spiritual life he wants to merge in the like they tell in our country
i don't want to take another birth i have to merge in the existence of god
so just like bhakti siddhanta maharaj gave examples if you see a train
at night it is it is pitch dark and you just see very very strong light coming from the engine
of the train and you may think oh train means only light some source of light
in a similar fashion Krishna is having tremendous effulgence in his body so without Krishna's mercy
you directly try to observe him then you will simply observe light so people tell god is only
light god is not light god is having a form but that form is very very effulgent so initially
people think i have to merge and thus i want peace i don't want to enjoy these senses which
create only misery in my life so this is actually also a self-interested desire i want peace in my
life so actually a sanyasi is also not a sanyasi who wants to merge in the existence of god rather
than engaging in satisfaction of god and such a desire prabhupada is mentioning is greater than
any material desire but it is not without self-interest greater is used in the sense it
is better better than satisfying the senses is try to merge yourself in the effulgence but still
it is not without self-interest that is good at least you don't want to do
sense enjoyment but still you are self-interested you also cannot be called an actual renouncer
similarly the next level is yogi yogi knows that god has got form but he wants to not merge in the
light coming out of Krishna's body but in Krishna's body directly wants to go and merge similarly the
mystic yogi who practices the yoga system with hard half open eyes seizing all material activity
is desire some satisfaction for his personal self he also wants satisfaction either these mystic
yogis they want some powers they get ashtasiddhis they become smaller than the smallest heavier than
the heaviest greater than the greatest like putana aghasur trinavarta great huge demons
they were expanding like body to many many miles this is yoga siddhi
and controlling others minds and all these various siddhis they develop so either they
want siddhis or they want to merge in the body of Krishna this is also self-interest
so that is why so-called ashtanga yogi or so-called gyani yogi cannot be called an actual sannyasi
but a person acting in Krishna consciousness works for the satisfaction of the whole without
self-interest a krishna conscious person has no desire for self-satisfaction his criteria for
success is satisfaction of krishna and thus he is perfect sannyasi or a perfect yogi
lord chatanya the highest professional symbol of renunciation plays in this way
now
so chatanya maha prabhu is praying now i do not want wealth now i do not want many many followers
now i don't want great beautiful women wife who is described in choices of poetries or i do not
want praises by the people also then do i want liberation oh no more birth i just want i don't
want to come back in this miserable world no chatanya maha prabhu tells i am ready to come
back to this miserable world only one time i want to come back next time krishna you please stop
my birth and death no life after life let me suffer from birth death old age and disease
but there is only one desire which i have and what is that
let me be engaged in your causeless devotional service
means i want something so i am trying to please krishna i want my peace of mind so i am chanting
Hare Krishna maha mantra i want settlement in my life so i am chanting Hare Krishna maha mantra
uh i'm doing devotional service this is called hethuki no let there be a
disaster in my life many many repeated births and deaths many many problems but let me always
be engaged life after life in your devotional service this is my only desire
so devotee practices a very high kind of renunciation sometimes devotees understand that
okay yes material life material enjoyment yes actually there is no satisfaction hankering only
increases but then they hanker after spiritual pleasure that is very good prabhupada tells this
is the way hankering after spiritual pleasure when you hanker after it then automatically you
will be able to control all the senses like i shared the quote prabhupada is telling simply
you chant this Hare Krishna maha mantra and try to hear each and every word Hare Krishna Hare
Krishna when you're chanting Hare you think you're directly contacting you're taking shelter of
lotus feet of Radharani when you chant Krishna you're taking shelter of lotus feet of Krishna
as soon as you chant Hare Krishna you're in direct touch with God
so in this way when you try to hear very very attentively then you will develop
you will get taste you will get enjoyment and so much enjoyment you will get you will tell oh for
this enjoyment i can give up anything just like people give up so many things for certain kind
of addictions they give up their uh we know you know when small boys they get addicted to computer
game they are not interested in eating they are not interested in interested in going out meeting
their friends not interested in many other things they are not interested in eating they are not
interested in many other things because they are getting this pleasure in a similar fashion simply
by attentive respectful and regulated chanting every day hearing every word discreetly understanding
every word is a unique personality in this way when we serve we will develop some taste and that
taste would be so nice then a person automatically is willing to give up and he gets strength also
to give up all the unwanted habits
unwanted desires material desires so this is very very important without self-interest
so a person works only for the satisfaction of Krishna without material self-interest and then
there is another uh higher uh renunciation a person gives up spiritual pleasure also
so one devotee was sharing uh it is mentioned nectar of devotion also so when once you finish
all these books then you should read nectar of devotion very high kind the pinnacle of
devotional service the actual mood of uh pure devotional service is explained there
so in nectar of devotion it is explained how uh and in chatanicharita amrit also it is explained
is explained the devotees are so much absorbed in love for krishna one devotee as soon as he
would see peacock feather he would immediately remember krishna and he would come in ecstasy
and they would faint and fall down so this is the level of
spiritual life this is the level of pleasure that devotee derives in spiritual life
so much pleasure that devotee faint simply by seeing one peacock feather
so in a similar fashion once a devotee was fanning lord chatanya and he was getting
again he was going to faint but then he controlled himself and he rejected that
spiritual pleasure so that he can continue seva krishna's charioteer also he comes in ecstasy
becomes stunned and he is about to faint when he sees krishna riding on the chariot but he gives
up that pleasure so that he can serve as a charioteer to krishna similarly prabhupada could
have lived in vrindavan vrindavan is a place where krishna is always personally present
manifest for the devotees and manifest for us but always he's personally present that is his
personal place but prabhupada left that place to go out go abroad this called spiritual uh
sacrificing even spiritual pleasure so one devotee personally shared this but when actually a person
is willing to sacrifice even a spiritual pleasure then actually unlimited spiritual pleasure is
open for him so that is why we should not worry so krishna is a person he is a conscious person
just like the parents are more than conscious for the demands of the child who cannot speak
who is totally dependent similarly if you don't expect any pleasure we simply want to serve i
should simply see moment to moment every moment i am spending for the satisfaction of krishna
and then krishna will give material pleasure spiritual pleasure whatever is required everything
the floodgates would open for such a devotee who is working in such a manner for krishna
so when devotee was sharing his experience so usually we do not want to get disturbed
4 15 our sadhana starts or 4 30 5 o'clock in some temples so 4 15 to 9 15 we have sadhana
so devotee don't want to get disturbed at all for these five hours they just want to
chant and hear chant and hear dancing here continuously keep on chanting and hearing
sometimes kirtan sometimes japa sometimes bhagavatam five hours continuously they want
to do shravanam and kirtanam without thinking anything about this material world or any other
activities but it is very important to preach the jivas also morning time is a good time for
preaching people are peaceful they have gotten up offices or colleges have not started so this
devotee had very nice chanting he was chanting in the morning and then this new seva had come
and on that day especially the chanting was so very nicely he was absorbed in chanting
and he was getting very nice pleasure but then he had to go out of temple for taking this class for
some new boys who were picking up krishna consciousness so then he was thinking so i
have to give up this pleasure and i have to go and take class but with a heavy heart what can
be done class has to be taken so he went there he stopped his chanting in between and then he went
for the class and then he told that prabhu when i gave class that day so much pleasure i got while
giving the class while sharing this knowledge much more than what i was getting enchanting
so that is why we have to understand krishna is called govindam go means senses and go also means
cows vind means pleasure one who gives pleasure to the senses is krishna krishna is the source
of all pleasure krishna is the reservoir of all pleasure so if you are trying to satisfy krishna
krishna is a person when he wants to give pleasure to you who can stop
so pravapa's father would tell pravapa this many times so god has got many hands you've got only
two hands if god wants to take away how can you protect with two hands and if god wants to give
you how can you receive it two hands so that is why if krishna is pleased by your service
irrespective of whatever circumstances you are in irrespective of whatever you are doing if
krishna is satisfied always you will have unlimited satisfaction in your life so that is why
we should not worry much about we should not worry at all about material pleasure that is not
pleasure such thing only increases hankering in our life dissatisfied we always are and sometimes
when we are in the beginning of spiritual life because we are having so much contamination so
much disease of bodily concept we have we may not get spiritual pleasure immediately still without
worrying whether spiritual pleasure sometimes we are getting or we are not getting we should see
and our prayer should be when we are chanting hari krishna mantra the mood should be please
krishna let me engage myself every moment in your service no moment should go wasted without your
satisfaction in my life and if a devotee has served krishna in such a manner every moment he
has been able to serve krishna or maximum moments that is a satisfaction that is in that we should
take satisfaction and then you will see if you maintain such an attitude automatically
spiritual pleasure very soon will start flowing in the heart of such a sincere devotee
so this is very important word please remember without self-interest this we do not know
everyone is working for self-interest some people think satisfying my mind and body will satisfy me
some people think satisfying the senses of my family members will satisfy me
no sir either for yourself or for family members or for anybody if you are not working for krishna
satisfaction we are simply thief thief is always anxious he's never satisfied
so that is why krishna explains this first step of the yoga system what is that
what is called renunciation is the same as yoga or linking oneself with the supreme
for no one can become a yogi unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification so krishna
is still arjuna you are thinking if you are if you go for yoga you will not be able to
take sannyas which is very important for spiritual life but you understand sannyas is automatically
included in yoga why because unless a person takes sannyas third line of the verse
no one can become a yogi unless he renounces the desire for sense gratification so what is sannyas
krishna has explained in the previous verse sannyas means giving up the results of the
activity desire to enjoy the senses desire for self-interest that has to be given up
so sankalpa means self-satisfaction or material desires a sannyas the person who has not
renounced the desire for sense gratification he cannot become a yogi
so that is why roop goswami is mentioned in the upadesha amrita that is very very important book
for all of us who want to start our spiritual life practical instructions which we have to
implement in our life are given just like which we play before the lecture many times
roop goswami gave 11 verses of nectar of instruction which is very very important
so the first verse is this thing only
bhaktisdan maharaj was asked by one of his disciples that why is so many people they are
following all the rules and regulations so strictly
why they are not able to advance sufficiently so bhaktisdan maharaj told they are not advancing
because of secret bad habits or personal desires material desires so the material attachments
or these bad habits which we have an arthas they are compared to anchor of boat how much ever you
may row with great strength and great force if the anchor is down boat is not going to move
it will move around the anchor you will think it is moving it is going around the anchor only
you keep on rowing the boat so that is why unless we unless somebody controls the six vegas
roop goswami has mentioned first of all please control the vegas
yes if you simply keep on chanting one day automatically you will give up but that will
take a very long time so voluntarily we should practice to control the six vegas which are the
vega vega means force we have six forces in the body there is a force to speak urge to speak
unnecessary things so we should see any statement which i am making is it for the satisfaction of
krishna either directly for the krishna satisfaction krishna katha or if i speak these words i get some
resources which i can use in the service of krishna so unless my speech is there for satisfaction
of krishna i should not speak so mind has got various forces so many thoughts they come most
of them random and unwanted anger i cannot control it and i want to express my anger
i want to taste various food stuffs the force of the belly i want to fill my belly
force of the reproductive organs these are six forces which are capturing all the conditioned
souls so a person has to control get free from these vegas
person should practice to tolerate not getting disturbed by these vegas then he can understand
and preach krishna consciousness so unless these vegas are so controlling the vegas means what okay
now i will not speak anything i will remain silent entire day i will never become angry in my life i
will always remain very very peaceful i will not eat anything i will just take water or take some
simple things or give up eating altogether no so this control is meant for less intelligent people
a boy who's very naughty teacher makes him stand in one place
don't move stand here with raised hands because he's naughty if you let his senses lose he will
do mischief in the class but a student who is why his teacher tells come please speak you
explain the answer to others also sometimes he's encouraged to teach also on behalf of teacher
so that is why ruba goswami is recommending the positive process of self-control
i am having very good control over my car it does not mean i put in the garage entire day
but i am able to drive it properly so proper sense control means you are able to drive the
senses for the satisfaction of krishna so controlling vacho vega means 24 hours you
can chant Hare Krishna Mahamantra or you can speak about Krishna that is called controlling
vacho vegam 24 hours our tongue should be engaged in service of Krishna
making mind thoughtless is very very difficult and although it is possible for some time
ultimately it proves to be a failure so thought should be engaged in thinking of the lotus feet
of Krishna the yogis are thinking of this form of Krishna within their heart
so mine should be engaged in thinking of lotus feet of Krishna
if a person decides i will never become angry in my life he will fall down in spiritual life
so bhagavatam mentions if a Krishna or his devotees are being offended and if a person
does not become angry he will fall down in spiritual life so for a person who is getting
angry for personal reasons such religions or such instructions are there at least do not become
angry because there is no knowledge of god and devotees what to speak of getting angry
for protection of god and devotees so arjuna he became very angry nobody can fight without anger
lord hanuman became very angry burned down the entire city so anger is very good and recommended
and required it is must that you should become angry when god or his devotees are being offended
if a person does not become angry at that time then he will fall down in a spiritual life so
anger also should be controlled and thus even god becomes angry some people are not able to
understand oh ramchandra became angry when the ocean did not respond he may be some devata
powerful man but not god god cannot be angry so they don't understand god also becomes angry
so one should become angry only for the satisfaction of god and devotees in their service
crow in the that way crow the vegam can be controlled
udhar upastha vegam udhar is having very strong vega how to control it not eating anything is
very difficult so that is why you eat eat krishna prasadam very nicely in that way you can control
udhar vegam upastha vegam controlling the genitals so that also can be controlled
for those who are always relishing krishna consciousness they can tolerate such urges
if that much realization is not there then use the forces of reproductive organs for producing a
nice krishna conscious child by following the regulations which are mentioned so in this way
all these vegas can be very nicely used and should be used for the service of krishna this is called
real sannyas and real renunciation you should act krishna is telling but you should not be attached
to the results for your enjoyment you should give up the desire for enjoying the results
however controlling senses in such a manner is the first step of yoga
people think oh let me eat whatever let me drink every day three cups of tea
and i'll become a very nice yoginosa so yoga means control of mind and senses it begins with that
so we should see am i following the dictations of mind at the end of the day i see oh my mind
dragged me to so many places so then it means it is i have to work upon my mind i should control
the mind mind should not control me i should control the senses my tongue tongue should not
control me i should control my anger anger should not control me anger is driving me
so this is very very important so we should try to practice this self-control and how to practice
i request all of you please read nectar of instruction first verse before the next class
you can search online i have shared on telegram channel also the links of prabhupada books
you search nectar of instruction in that and please read the purport very long purport is there
of first verse so prabhupada is giving how actually these vegas can be controlled and we
can use them for satisfaction of krishna but we have to positively work upon the control of senses
if i am getting pushed away day in and day out morning to evening by the senses
then how much ever we chant it will take a very very long time to advance but you control the
senses and then you practice chanting also side by side try to do reading engage in krishna service
then we see advancement is very very fast so please don't forget this first step of yoga that
is controlling the senses in the service of krishna and following thus four regulatory principles is
very very important so otherwise we may follow very very nicely prabhupada tells it will take
a long time many many lives to do it
so krishna mentions
so for one who is new fight in the eightfold yoga system so it is not recommended that he can
control his senses from the very beginning so in this now krishna is beginning to explain this
ashtanga yoga so in this ashtanga yoga ultimately as we discussed previously a person should stop
eating completely a person should stop watching anything person should stop hearing anything
and direct all the persons should stop activities of legs activities of hands activities of
genitals activities of rectum anus everything he has to control
five active senses five knowledge acquiring senses nothing should work whole body should be still
and it should be sitting in that place completely so this stage is very very difficult
this is called yoga rudha advanced stage of yoga and our rukshor means beginning stages of yoga
so in the beginning stages of yoga krishna is telling work is said to be the means
and for one who has already attained to yoga cessation of all material activities is said to
be the means so in the initial stages a person is supposed to do pranayama various posture sitting
postures so that he can control his mind and senses but an advanced devotee need not do all
these postures and he can and finally when he's very advanced he is moving he's talking he's
walking in every situation he is able to always think of krishna within his heart this is called
advanced stage of yoga so that is why krishna is telling arjuna in the beginning anyway even if a
person is following this ashtanga yoga system stopping all the activities is not recommended
but engagement is the beginning
a person is said to have attained yoga when having renounced all material desires
he neither acts for sense gratification nor engages in fruitive activities so then a yogi
who's very advanced by such practice how can we understand he is advanced he will not do these
two things whole world is engaged in two things what is that sense gratification or fruitive
activity either the people are enjoying the senses or fruitive activity means they are
working in such a manner so that they can get resources for enjoyment that's it these two
things are keeping everybody engaged morning to evening i work in the office that is called
fruitive activity and when i come back i walk i watch youtube videos i drink sleep and enjoy
various pleasures so either fruitive activity or sense gratification
and a yogi will not participate either fruitive activity or sense gratification
yogi will always think how moment to moment i'm trying to satisfy krishna so with this we will
