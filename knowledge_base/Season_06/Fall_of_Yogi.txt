Yes, text number 36.
Translation.
Asayatatmana means unbridled.
For one whose mind is unbridled,
self-realization is difficult work.
But he whose mind is controlled
and whose tries by right means
is assured of success.
That is my opinion.
So we are seeking
opinion of valuable
advanced personalities
in this material world.
Now Krishna is also offering his valuable opinion.
The perfection of life,
the highest peace, highest bliss and happiness
can be attained by self-realization.
But Lord Krishna is telling
it is my opinion.
For one whose mind is unbridled,
self-realization is difficult work.
And if the mind is controlled
and he applies the mind in right means,
he is assured of success.
So this point is very very
important.
We are following the practices as we discussed.
We should see that our mind is also getting
controlled.
If we are not trying control of mind,
simply the external senses are engaged,
then that is not Krishna Consciousness.
Krishna Consciousness means
maam anusmar yudhya cha.
Arjuna was told to shoot the arrows,
along with shooting the arrows,
person is supposed to remember Krishna also.
Maam tasmas
and how he is supposed to remember,
when he is supposed to remember,
whatever activity he is doing,
tasmas sarveshu kaaleshu
at all times without exception.
Whatever activity you are doing,
maam anusmar, you should be thinking of me.
So Srila Prabhupada explains.
So thinking of Krishna is very important.
Although Krishna is in the background
of entire war,
Lord Krishna is present
personally on the chariot with Arjuna.
So Krishna is in the background of
entire fighting, he is there with Arjuna.
Still Arjuna is being requested by Krishna,
ordered by Krishna.
Maam anusmar yudhya cha
sarveshu kaaleshu
at all times think of me.
This is yoga practice.
So a devotee sees Krishna externally
as well as sees Krishna internally also.
Always he is supposed to see Krishna.
So this thinking of Krishna
is very very important.
So if the mind is not
controlled, mind is going here and there,
only we are shooting arrows,
then that does not become
very advanced form of yoga.
Although shooting arrows on the order of Krishna
is the beginning of yoga.
But then we have to control our mind
and practice
thinking of Krishna also.
And how to think of Krishna?
Now we can tell
my mind is unbridled, it is not possible
for me then to perfect yoga.
No, everyone's mind is unbridled.
A small child is not born
usually, except
are there, Shukade Goswami was there,
four Kumaras are there, Narad Muni are there,
but they are very rare.
People are born in ignorance with unbridled,
uncontrolled mind.
But the treatment is there
to control a mind, tame a mind
and make it perfectly under control.
And what is the treatment?
Srila Prabhupada explains in the first
line. The supreme personality
of Godhead declares
that one who
does not accept the proper
treatment to detach
the mind from material engagement
can hardly achieve success in
self-realization. So what is the treatment?
The treatment is to detach
the mind from material engagement.
Why the mind is disturbed? Because the mind
is attached to some gross or
subtle sense objects.
If the mind is attached to certain kind of food
item, that food item is not there
or the food is not rightly cooked
the mind is disturbed.
Or you are thinking, when will I get
that food? Or if you did not
get or the food was not
nicely prepared, then we are lamenting.
So in this way, because
the mind is attached to the sense object
of tongue, the mind becomes disturbed.
Mind goes in the future, when
will I have that food? Or in
the present, the mind laments, if it is
not right. So in this way
mind becomes disturbed.
Similarly for
ears, for nose,
for skin, for all the sense objects.
If we are attached to anything
that is the cause of all disturbance of mind.
So that is why mind should be detached
from material engagement
But mind and senses need some engagement,
they should be engaged in the service of Krishna.
So if a person is not practicing this
proper treatment, he is not accepting
and that is detachment of the mind.
And how do we practice detachment?
Detachment for the general impersonalist
yogi, who has no knowledge
about the personality of God.
God is a person having senses, form
and all the opulences. For them
detachment is very difficult.
They are supposed to stop the
activities of the senses.
Do not see, do not hear,
that is very tough.
But we don't stop
the activities of the senses, we engage
senses in positive activities.
So that is easy process,
specially for the people in Kalyuga
as well as the most powerful
process than what the other
impersonalist yogis follows.
So easy does not mean it will not fetch
a sufficient result. The process
is also easy and the results are also
topmost.
But the only difficulty is trying to
find the right means,
having the right guidance of a pure
devotee of Krishna, who can teach us
how to engage senses in the service of Krishna.
So somehow or the other if a
person is able to find the pure devotee
of God, then this process is possible.
Otherwise this process of bhakti yoga
is not possible by simply reading
books, by chanting God's name
also directly, without coming
in touch, taking shelter of a pure devotee
of Krishna. That is why
Lord Krishna tells in
Bhagavad Gita. How to read
Bhagavad Gita we have seen in the fourth
chapter.
Pranipaten pariprasnena
sevaya.
Pranipat means complete
surrender.
Prakrashterupena nipat
We offer dandavats, complete,
we fall down in front of spiritual
master Krishna. That means I am
completely surrendered.
So pranipatena, complete surrender
is required to spiritual master.
And Krishna tells you do like this, then
only you will get the knowledge. Pranipatena
then you inquire first of all
completely surrender.
Find out, use your intelligence,
use your hearing process, reading power
to understand
where I can find a person whom I can
completely surrender and then completely
surrender and then question by
engaging in seva service.
In this way the knowledge of Bhagavad Gita
is revealed, spiritual knowledge is revealed.
It is not like mundane
material knowledge whereby reading books or
hearing some lectures impersonally
without pleasing the teacher, a person
can get it. Here without pleasing
spiritual master, Lord Krishna explains
there is no other way.
So disciple should be eager to
understand what is the
desire of my spiritual master
and then try to fulfill that desire
and please the spiritual master.
By the pleasure of spiritual master, entire
Vedic knowledge is revealed to the disciple.
So a person should
try to find a
spiritual master, take this proper treatment
and the treatment is detachment
of the mind from material engagement
engaging the mind in service of Krishna.
So when Arjuna saw this, that
such mind control is
required. Here Krishna is not explaining
Bhakti Yoga but explaining the
process of
Ashtanga Yoga which is very
tough. So then Arjuna
expressed his inability
that Krishna I cannot follow this
and I or any
devotee may fall down
following this process. It is so tough.
So Arjuna is asking the question here.
Arjuna said,
What is the destination
of the man of faith
who does not persevere,
who in the beginning takes to the process
of self-realization but who later desists
due to worldly mindedness
and thus does not attain perfection
in mysticism.
So as we saw previously, determination
of the mind from material engagement
in service of Krishna
is very tough.
So as we saw previously, determination
perseverance is
very much required
because a person
will commit mistakes, Maya
will test. As soon as a person
decides I will now follow nicely
advanced in spiritual consciousness
immediately Maya will put stumbling
blocks, will try to block
by giving various allurements
or some other difficulties.
So Arjuna is asking who in the beginning takes to the
process of self-realization but later
desists due to worldly mindedness
and thus does not attain perfection.
What is the destination?
This is a natural question. Many people ask
that, Prabhu, what
happens if I do not enjoy life also
nicely? I am controlling
my tongue, restraining all my other senses.
Spiritual life is also not perfect
and material enjoyment
I have left. So what will happen to me?
Ka chinnobhaya vibhrishtash
chinnabhram ivanashyati
apratishtho maha baho
vimoodho brahmanapati
Oh mighty
Krishna, does not such a
man being deviated from the path
of transcendence perish
like a riven cloud
with no position in any sphere?
So Prabhupada is explaining
there are two ways to progress.
Those who are materialists have no interest
in transcendence, therefore
they are more interested in material advancement
by economic development
or in promotion to the
higher planets by appropriate work.
Now
this current civilization does not have
knowledge that you can go to other planets
just like the aboriginals in the jungle
may not have knowledge of cities and the luxuries
of cities.
Similarly, there are many many opulences
in other advanced planets
and those people who have knowledge
they work in such a manner so that
they are promoted to those planets.
But others less intelligent, they work
for economic development in this planet only.
When one takes to the path
of transcendence, one has to seize
all material activities
and sacrifice all forms of
so called material happiness.
If the aspiring transcendentalist
fails, then he apparently loses both
ways. In other words
he can enjoy neither material happiness
nor spiritual success.
He has no position, he is like a
riven cloud. So Arjuna is
expressing the mind of a common man
that I could not attain
spiritual perfection, could not
enjoy material world also.
Then is that
situation not like that of
a riven cloud? Riven cloud means
a small piece of cloud which
got disassociated from
the cloud body.
Now unless there is sufficient mass of
cloud collected together, it doesn't
condense as rainfall.
So a small cloud, it could not attach itself
to the mass of cloud, will not come down
as rain, neither it could remain with the
clouds. So it
remains floating in the sky somewhere
without any
association of clouds or
sky or that of earth.
So this question is very
important. And
Arjuna is asking
This is my doubt O Krishna and I ask you to dispel it completely. But for yourself no one is to be found who can destroy this doubt.
So this is important question and we all consider
this in any attempt.
If a person is working very hard
appearing for an examination
he has worked very hard but
suppose he does not clear the cut off
then what is his future?
What is the other option?
So any person should be worried
I have worked very hard in this endeavor
now what I am supposed to do?
So such
stoppage of spiritual life
incompletion of spiritual life
is called fall down
The unbridled mind because of worldly
mindedness sometimes
it pulls a yogi down
in his spiritual life.
And Prabhupada
tells we should be very very careful we are following
the rules and regulations nicely
but we may not fall down. And a
fall down means a gap of millions
of life.
Some fortunate people may get chance immediately
some others may have to wait for many many
lives also.
So it is
very very risky business.
So today we will try to
understand about a person a sage
who was very very powerful
and
he also suffered from
a fall down in his spiritual life.
So this is very
very old story.
In the
family of Maharaj
Ikshwaku came
a very great king
his name was Yuvanashva
and Maharaj Yuvanashva
he was desiring a child
but by the
will of providence he was unsuccessful
he married hundred wives
but none of the wives could give king
a child.
So he became
frustrated and he went into jungle
along with all his wives and he became
very depressed.
So there he met some Brahmanas
and by the mercy
of the Brahmanas
they organized an Indrayagya
for the king.
So this Indrayagya is very very suitable
for getting a son getting a child.
So they organized Indrayagya and then
they got by their
mystic power finally
sanctified water which the wives
of the king were supposed to drink
and thus they will be able to get a child.
But somehow
in the middle of night king became
very very thirsty.
In order to quench his thirst he went to the place
of sacrifice and all
the Brahmanas were taking rest at that time
so he thought what to do now
and he was very thirsty he started looking for water
and then he found water
and drank it the same water which the wives
were supposed to drink.
And in the morning when the sages got up
and they found the water pot empty
alas they told
where has the water gone?
And then they discovered the king
drank the entire water.
So they understood this will of providence
is very strange
nobody can stop what the supreme
personality of God desires to do
and thus they offered respects to the supreme
personality that how much ever
you try Krishna's plan
only will unfold as per his
desires.
So the king drank the water now king
will become pregnant instead of
wife. So it was very difficult
situation. And the king
actually became pregnant also.
And eventually
he gave birth from the lower
right abdomen Bhagavatam mentions.
And somehow
because he was having the blessings
of Brahmanas if there are blessings of great
personalities a person can be
safe from such accidents.
So he did not die
but he gave birth
to a child from the lower right abdomen
by the mercy of Brahmanas he was saved.
And
then this king
who took birth from Yuvanashva he became
known as the great king Mandhata.
Mandhata was very
very powerful king.
And again the same word is used
which was used for Maharaj Amrish.
Saptadweep
Avanim. Avanim is this planet
which is called Saptadweep
Mandhata was the king of seven islands.
He was the lone ruler of the entire
planet.
So thus we understand how
geography was very very clear.
This earth has got seven islands
the seven continents it was clear.
And Mandhata was a sole
ruler with no competitor
at all.
And he was so powerful king
that the name is mentioned
the rogues thieves and other
dacoits like Ravana they were also
scared because of the presence of Mandhata
on the planet.
So Ravana was so powerful
Lord Ramchandra came to kill him.
But Ravana was very scared of Mandhata.
So human being also can
become very very powerful.
So this king Mandhata
had got three sons
and
fifty daughters.
And all these fifty daughters
got married
to the sage Saubhari
the great sage Saubhari.
Why a sage sadhu will
marry so many wives?
Yes so this happened because of this spiritual
fall down. So once it so
happened Saubhari Muni was meditating
so this Mandhata was ruler of
the entire planet
capital was Mathura because he was a
great devotee of Krishna by the
potency bestowed upon him by Krishna
he was able to keep Ravana and all
such rogues away.
So all these
devotees of Krishna they are always
knowing this is the place of Krishna's eternal
past time whenever Lord Krishna appears
he appears here.
So all the yajus that is why they were
making the capital as Mathura
and King Mandhata being a great devotee
he was also ruling from Mathura.
And sage Saubhari
was meditating in the waters
of Yamuna which flows through Mathura
Vrindavan.
And just imagine such a powerful sage
as you would have seen in the creative
that he is sitting within water
and
some water
plantation
is growing from his body
so just imagine he would have
been sitting for a very very long time
so yogis were so very much powerful
they would meditate
on top of mountains
when it is temperature is
negative and they would meditate
deep within the water also.
So deep within the water many
yogis would do there are pachetas another
pure devotee set of pure devotees
who by the mercy of Lord Shiva
so many people tell
no Prabhu I am devotee of Lord
Shiva so how do I chant Krishna's name
so you please ask them request
them because we have many devotees
of Lord Shiva in our country.
So you ask them yes
you are devotee of Lord
Shiva devotee means you should obey the
instructions of Lord Shiva has
Lord Shiva told anywhere in any scripture
please chant my name
has Lord Shiva recommended anywhere
any kind of worship
then you should follow that has
Lord Shiva recommended any kind of process
then you should follow that
Lord Shiva never recommends
surrender only unto me rather
when mother Parvati asked Lord Shiva
so many aradhanas
are there which aradhana to do
so he told
among all the aradhanas worshiped
Lord Vishnu has to be worshiped
that is a top most worship
and Lord Shiva when the pachetas
were worshipping him
and those people who worshipped
Lord Shiva not for any material benefit
material benefit is very easily
because Lord Shiva is Vaishnavanam
Yathashambhu
he is the perfect Vaishnava
and he is always
meditating we see Lord Shiva is meditating
he is meditating upon
Lord Sankarshan expansion of
Lord Krishna within his heart always
and Lord Sankarshan only
expands as Anantasesh
as very great snake incarnation
having many many hoods
which support all the material universes
and thus because he is
devotee of Lord Sankarshan
in order to remember him
as a symbolism he is carrying snake
around his neck
this is the meaning why
Lord Shiva carries snake he is devotee
of the biggest snake original snake
Anantasesh
who is expansion of Lord Sankarshan
so Lord Shiva is always meditating
upon Lord Sankarshan within his heart
so if you ask for material desires
he doesn't wish to get
interrupted in his meditation but because
he has come in this material world one of
the assigned responsibilities to fulfill
material desires also so very quickly
if anybody calls him
it is a disturbance in his meditation
so immediately
he goes and gives okay please do not disturb me
go away but if a person is sincere
and sincerely asks
Lord Shiva please
tell me what is the absolute truth what is the aim of
life then Lord Shiva
guides appropriately
so Lord Shiva that is why has got
a bona fide disciplic succession just like
we come in the disciplic succession of Lord Brahma
Lord Shiva also has got a bona fide
guru shishya parampara which is called
Rudra Sampradaya
and
in Rudra Sampradaya
Lord Krishna is giving Vishnu
mantra only he is giving mantra
not about chanting his name but about
chanting the names of Lord Vishnu
but nevertheless
there are some people who worship
Lord Shiva and they are not satisfied
by that worship Ramana offered his head
to Lord Shiva who can be a greater
devotee than Ramana but now
Ramana was not satisfied in his life
so we are coming
from God we are always connected
to God so that is why by serving
God we will be satisfied automatically
so in this way we can understand
whom we are eternally related to
by satisfying that person we should automatically
become satisfied
so you go and
finding keep on serving the people
service of that
person will satisfy
when you are completely satisfied then you should
understand that he is God
so thus we can see
all the devotees who are having material
desires who are having spiritual desires
or who are having desire
of moksha impersonal liberation
all of them they got engaged in service
of Lord Krishna and got perfectly satisfied
thus we can understand Lord Krishna
only is the absolute truth God
so like Pracheta
Saubhari Muni also was meditating
in the water in the river
and suddenly
he saw two fishes
copulating in the water
and then his mind also
got agitated
and he developed desire I also want to
enjoy like this physical pleasures
and immediately Saubhari
Muni came out of water
and then Mathura
he went to the king of Mathura
and then he desired that
king I want to
marry one of your daughters
you are having so many daughters
give one daughter to me
now the king Mandhata became
perplexed
although Mandhata was very very powerful
he cannot deny a Brahmana
and the Brahmanas are more powerful than
any powerful king
and he understood now this Brahmana has come who is a
great yogi and
if he becomes angry then
anything can happen if he curses
I am destroyed
so the king
in a very tricky way he told
yes you want the hand of my daughter
so all my daughters are free
to marry the person they like
so you can kindly visit my daughters
and I have given them freedom
to choose their husband
so Saubhari Muni
understood that I am an old man
and my skin has become very
thin and my hairs have
turned grey and my head is also
always trembling it is not stable
he became very old moreover I am a yogi
girls do not like yogis
just like Ved Vyas also when he came down
in order to be a child
then
all those princesses they became
very much disturbed
Ambika, Ambalika
so one closed her eyes another turned pale
because the yogis
they don't care for material
appearance of the body they are sitting in the
jungle and always
enjoying relishing the pleasures within
so he understood now which daughter
will choose me such a yogi old man my head
is trembling
but he was a very powerful yogi so he told
ok the king is trying to smart me out
so by my yogic powers
I will take a form
that even celestial beauties will be attracted
towards me what to speak of
these material beauties here
what to speak of any earthly princesses
so by his yogic power immediately
he became a very very attractive
powerful young man
and then along with the messenger
of the king he was allowed to enter
the palace where all the princesses
were living and when
those princesses saw
this very beautiful young man
all of them desired to marry not one
all of them they desired I want to marry
and
actually they started fighting
they forgot all the sisterhood
and they thought he will
accept one of us as it
started fighting he is not fit for you
he is fit for me or I am fit for him
so this is how we see is the nature
of so called love in this material
world so love is based
on body so the same
yogi had he gone in old body
none of the princesses would have accepted
I don't want to marry this old man
the head is wobbling and
he is very skinny
person with grey hairs thin body
ugly body
but when he became very attractive simply
changed his dress now also
we are changing bodies anyway changing
and with the help of medical
science now people are able to change the
genders also man is
becoming woman woman is becoming man they are
able to put some hormones and change
the structure of the body gender
of the body so all this can
be done by mantras also
so there is a siddhi which
yogis and denizens of higher
planets have they can take any form that they
like so
also being a powerful yogi
he took this form and thus we see
so called love they started getting
so that is why all these things which
people are dying for
love and when there is no love
actually they die they commit suicide
and become depressed
so all these things are not worthy of
happiness or depression
all these subject are subject matters
of illusion just like
you are sitting in a car somebody comes
and loves your car so
then that is foolishness you may become happy
that the person is loving me no simply loving
your car or dress you go in another
car another dress they will not even identify
that is what happens here
we simply love machines all that
we see around us are machines
these different machines the rider of the
machines we have never seen
so this is the illusion of this material
world and all these princesses
they fell for the illusion I will marry
I will marry and eventually all
of them married and he became okay
I will accept fifty wives not one wife now
so he accepted all fifty of them
and
then this
Saubhari Muni he
by his yogic powers
Mandhata was king of entire
planet just imagine his opulence
but when Mandhata saw the
palace which Saubhari Muni
produced out of his yogic powers
he was bewildered
so just like here also there is a science
by which you can produce things
you put one brick over other and
then a palace will come out like that
so this is manual endeavors
similarly by mantric endeavor
simply by chanting some mantras
the same effect can be produced
so by the power of his mantras he could produce
wonderful palace having
many many lakes gardens
and having many maids
servants well decorated man servants
and Mandhata
when he came there his
pride got completely smashed
he was thinking I am king of
planet most opulent and when
he saw the opulence of this yogi he
he completely surrendered
and all his pride was banished
so this is the power of yogis
so they are interested in spiritual life but
if they want they can produce unlimited
material opulences which
the greatest materialist of this world also
cannot think so thus by
external appearance a person should not think
that spiritualist is very poor
poverty stricken not performing
no they voluntarily accept
poverty because when a person
is poor he practices
his dependence upon Krishna
so this is very very important we have to practice
depending upon Krishna
when a person sees that
I am not having
any money I am not having people around me
but still I am being taken care
every day I am being fed then he develops
dependence upon Krishna his faith
increases when you have money
you will think oh my money is feeding me
my money is protecting me or people
around me are protecting me so let
me have more of people and money around me
we will never develop faith on God
so Saubhari Muni
produced this wonder and Maharaj
Mandhata was awestruck seeing that opulence
and anyway Saubhari Muni
continued living in the palace
and then Bhagavatam
describes a very beautiful shloka
which I would like to share
with you this is from 9th canto of
Bhagavatam
in which pastimes of Lord Ramchandra
are also there
it mentions
So we all experience Krishna consciousness and we want to share this knowledge of Krishna consciousness
but somehow the people whom we want to share with
they don't develop faith
and they tell it is something imagination
or who has seen it and asked so many other questions
so this is how we should
preach those people
so this is a very nice shloka
evam graheshu abhirato
in this way Saubhari Muni graheshu abhirato
enjoyed sense gratification
in the material world
vishayan vividhay sukhai
vishaya means sense object
vivid means of various varieties
sukhai he enjoyed the happiness
derived from various kinds of
sense objects you can just imagine
he is richer than the richest
person on the planet
richer than the king of the emperor of the planet
what would be the opulence
we think of getting some opulence
in our life some power in our life
he is more powerful and opulent than the
king of entire planet
whom even Ramana was scared of
oh he must be having a wonderful life
let me also follow yoga and
have fifty wives
or husbands with me and enjoy nicely with them
will this satisfy us
so it is told
sevamana means
enjoying
atushyat
atushyat means satisfaction
atushyat means dissatisfaction
so even though he had fifty
wives not one two three or four
and what kind of wives extremely
qualified intelligent and beautiful
wives they were daughters of king
very well trained
most beautiful on planet
but still he was not satisfied
atushyat with the most
beautiful wives
having a very healthy body very strong
body very intelligent body powerful
body he could produce any material
comforts having unlimited servants and
opulences atushyat he was not
satisfied why he was
not satisfied not satisfied
the reason is given in the last line
stokai means by the drops of butter
iva means like
analah means fire
if you put drops of butter
onto the fire then what will happen
the fire will only increase
this is the way of material
life the material
desires are like fire which burn the
living entity and
we get disturbed by such burning
desires of the heart and we want to
satisfy we want to get rid of that
burning of the heart so we
take some sense objects what happens with the
sense objects the fire the
burning of the heart only increases
one cigarette two cigarette ten cigarettes
twenty cigarettes
six hours sleep eight hours sleep
ten hours sleep twelve hours sleep let me keep on
sleeping and like
this for all the pleasures
the fire increases increases increases
aaj stokai ivan
alai
so this every
materialist has experience
that is why we can tell okay you do not
understand spiritual life completely
but please understand whatever you
are doing makes
zero sense because
you are trying to satisfy
yourself but it only this material
enjoyment only increases the hankering
increases dissatisfaction
in our life just like putting butter
drops in the fire
this is the sum and substance of material life
this one line is sufficient
to summarize and
people attend various seminars
about goal setting to do proper
goal setting to give proper direction
to give right career counseling this thing
is sufficient that whatever
career you may choose
whatever so called satisfaction you may attain
you will not be satisfied
it will be just like
putting butter drops on fire
aaj stokai ivan alai
so thus it is very simple
entire material world is running on hallucination
although they see that
it is like that my desires only increase
but they don't understand
so we can see from the example of
Saubhari Muni one of the opulent persons planet
has seen he was not satisfied
we can see from our life also the same thing
so in this way if we preach by
praying to Krishna fortunately some sense
may strike the people who have not
turned their face towards spiritual life
that material
enjoyment material objects
they only increase this burning of the heart
so Saubhari Muni
was not satisfied
there after one day while Saubhari
Muni who was expert in chanting mantras
was sitting in a secluded
place he thought to himself
about the cause of his fall down
which was
that
so Saubhari Muni was thinking
that what happened I was so
nicely practicing meditation
deep within the water bed
and what I have created
all this is creating so much of dissatisfaction
in my life
so then he started
wondering why why this has happened
and then he remembered because
mean sangaha mean mean means
fishes I saw two fishes
enjoying within water and this
I developed
this desire
so Saubhari Muni tells oh alas
how I have destroyed my life
I was so nicely advancing
for a long time I was situated on the
Brahma platform
on amazing austerities
and I fell down from that spiritual platform
so why this happened
because
I saw two fishes copulating with each other
that is why in the Bhagavatam
it is mentioned
so all those people
who are nishkinchana
nishkinchana means something nishkinchana means
nothing who have no material desires
bhagavad bhajanon
mukhasya they have
oriented themselves to engage in the service
of Krishna
they want to cross
bhavasagar means this material world
is compared to an ocean
in this ocean a person is
this called bhavasagar bha means to become
we keep on becoming
different things
animal, man, fish, cat, dog
demon
so this is called bhavasagar
in this ocean we are suffering
who has decided to cross this material ocean
by engaging himself
in the service of Krishna
it is told
association with a materialist
who is very attracted
very much attracted, captivated by the opposite gender
it is
it is like consuming poison
this is very very bad
one should never do that
so who is attracted
to opposite sex, opposite gender
practically every materialist
so that is why association of
materialist is
prohibited
and Chaitanya maha prabhu
very strictly exhibited in his own
life
he had a very great devotee
king, his name was Maharaj Pratap Rudra
Maharaj Pratap Rudra was so
powerful that he was ruling Odisha
even though the Pathans, Muslims
were all around, they had captured the country
but he by the dint of his being
devotee of Lord Jagannath, Lord Chaitanya
maha prabhu, he was very powerful
he was able to ward off all these
invaders
and he desired that
he requested associates of maha prabhu
please let me have darshan of maha prabhu
maha prabhu refused
I cannot see a materialist
the kings because they are usually
materialist, they live amidst lot of
sense objects
so anybody who is very fond of enjoying sense objects
especially who is very much
attracted with the opposite sex, it is told
don't associate with such people
it is like consuming poison
so that is why association
of materialist is very very bad
Saubhari Muni a powerful sage
he associated with fishes
who were enjoying material pleasures
so one such desire, similar thing
happened with Ajamil
Ajamil was a Brahmana
and I think most of you would have heard who are regular
the story, Ajamil was a very nice
Brahmana, has very beautiful wife
and he was going to
collect woods for fire sacrifice
and in the jungle he saw
he was, he did not
make a plan that I will go and witness
such a thing, he was going to collect
woods for yagya, a very divine thing
but then when he was returning from
the jungle then he saw
Shudra and Shudrani, means low character
man and woman
they were embracing each other
and enjoying and their eyes were rolling
they were intoxicated
and such a sight completely bewildered
him, he brought that prostitute to his
house, he told his wife to go away
Kanya Kubje, Vijaya Kashyadish
happened in Kanpur, so all these places
are mentioned, Kanya Kubje was the
name, Kannauj, it is now known as
by that name, near Kanpur
so he also
saw this and got bewildered
Saubhari Muni also saw this and he got bewildered
so that is why one such thought
can immediately create devastation
in a person's life
so one should be very very careful
not to associate with the materialist at all
and not that
no, I am not getting affected
I have been going with my friends
they drink but I do not drink, I just sit there
no, continuously a
materialist emanates material energy
just like spiritual
spiritualist emanates spiritual energy
we are getting influenced and when there is threshold
reached, we also fall down
so
Srila Prabhupada explains
Ajamil saw just
one case, these things were very very
uncommon, only very less
cultured people will embrace and have such
public display of affection
and not public display, it was jungle
in the jungle it was happening, now in public
it is happening
so some devotees who came to Mumbai
they were shocked to see the culture here
that how people are so shameless in the open
they do everything
and
Prabhupada told then what to speak of western
countries, those sides which
was very rare, Ajamil just once saw
in his life, he got bewildered
these sides are very common in every street on
the west
so he told but if a person
prays sincerely to Haridas Thakur to
Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, he is very sincere
in chanting of Hare Krishna mantra, he can be
saved from such things
so why Saubhari Muni being an advanced yogi
was not able to protect himself
there is another reason given by
Srila Vishnu Chakvarthi Thakur
he explained
Saubhari Muni when he was meditating
there in that place, then Garun Dev
he wanted to eat a fish
and the fish took shelter
of Saubhari Muni
and Saubhari Muni
in ignorance
showing some material compassion
he gave the fish shelter
and thus he impeded the activities
of Garun Dev who is carrier of Lord Vishnu
so if any fish is offering
its body in the service of Lord Garuna
that fish is going to get liberated
Lord Garuna is eternal
associates carrier of Lord Vishnu
pure devotee, as powerful as
Lord Vishnu, but he impeded
the activity of Vaishnava
so this is called Vaishnava Pradha
so that is why
King Rahugan, we saw in the
previous shloka, Rahugan and Jadh Bharat were
discussing about
mind control we saw
so King Rahugan
tells, I am not afraid of the thunderbolt
of Indra, I am not afraid of
any other denizens of heavenly planets
or XYZ, but I am afraid
of Vaishnava Pradha
so this Vaishnava Pradha, offending
the activities of, impeding the activities
of Vaishnava or creating
some kind of offense to a Vaishnava is
very very dangerous
and all these material desires they get
awakened in the heart
so we should be very very careful
not to commit Vaishnava offense
Vaishnava offense is called
mad elephant offense
Hathi Mata, a mad
elephant, if he enters the garden
you could have cultivated your garden
very very nicely, but
if elephant enters, there is a big tree
it has grown very strong
for 20 years of cultivation
it can immediately
uproot, so you
practice spiritual life for 10, 20
30, 40 years and then if you commit
Vaishnava Pradha, immediately
this tree of spiritual life is uprooted
person gets completely bewildered and lost
so that is why the
learned people, if anything
which scares them the most is this Vaishnava
Pradha, not
to offend the Vaishnavas, it is very very
important, how can we offend
the Vaishnavas? Either
just like Duryodhana
and party, they were good Kshatriyas
but why they were killed? Because
Krishna did not tolerate
their Vaishnava Pradha, physically
they tried to give poison and
burn down and all other things
to the Pandavas, so physically
offending the Vaishnava, very serious
a person is completely finished, his family
is finished in this thing, and not
just us, entire family, society
village suffers in Vaishnava Pradha
if you commit to a powerful
Vaishnava, all those who are connected to us
they also go to hell, they also suffer
so physically offending a Vaishnava
verbally offending a Vaishnava
speaking some words, unkind words
to a Vaishnava, or even
mental offence to a Vaishnava
and even it is told in the scriptures
not being happy upon
seeing the Vaishnava is also
Vaishnava offence
and as long as we commit
offences we cannot advance
so whenever we see any Vaishnava around us
any devotee, we should become very very glad
and happy in the heart
so seeing a Vaishnava, if we are not happy, that is also
an offence, so what to speak of
speaking something or doing something
which can agitate
a Vaishnava
then if you offend a Vaishnava, so we have seen
many good devotees
they were doing very very nicely in spiritual life
but Vaishnava Pradha
and they are very good preachers, but forgotten
and gone away from spiritual life
forgot the basics of Krishna consciousness also
and some of them
they die also
so it is very very dangerous
so Sabarimuni got
attracted, yes we have to keep ourselves in
the good association
so it is just like having
good immunity, if immunity is good
then even though virus is there
around us, it will not affect us
even though it is within the body, it will not
get activated, if immunity is strong
in a similar fashion
if we are following
the rules and regulations very very nicely
we do our morning program nicely
we go out for preaching
we are engaged in Sankirtana
even though we are associating with materialists
we will not take their qualities
but we will put our qualities in them
but if there is some mistake
in following the rules and regulations
or if you commit such offences
take something which reduces our immunity
then as soon as we contact virus
we are finished
so we should protect ourselves from virus also
we should not have bad association
that is why we take this association
of materialists very lightly
please be very very careful
association does not mean
just turning the other way when you see
a materialist because that way
majority is materialist
say Hare Krishna, hello, good morning, good evening to them
have
accordial
relation with them but don't
intimately mix with them
what is intimate mixing?
revealing your heart, hearing their
confidential things
in this way person becomes intimate
exchanging gifts
giving something, taking something
going in, eating at their place
and in this way
exchange of food items
so all these things are priti lakshanam
association, this should be avoided
we can have good
accordial, high by relationship
but this intimate association should be with
the devotees, there are sufficient devotees also
by Krishna's mercy, if there are no
devotees simply we chant morning and evening
read Bhagavad Gita, invite some people to
re-discuss with them and chant with them
they will also become soon devotees
it is a simple process to
create devotees
and then we should associate only with devotees
have our social circle with them
and talk with them, move with them
so association with materialist
is dangerous, we should minimize
as much as possible
it is a materialist association
only which takes people, many
get interested in spiritual life
but they are taken away from such association
because of such association
so thus
Vaishnava Prad was committed by
Saubhari Muni, he impeded the activity of
Vaishnava and thus all these material
desires they came in the heart
because of material desires he got
carried away and his mind
started suggesting
how nice your life will be
see these fishes are enjoying nicely, you also
can enjoy, so that is why we should
not depend upon the mind, Saubhari Muni
tells because of these various
gunas, three modes of nature
my mind developed other thoughts
so mind gives us thoughts
depending on the modes of nature
sometimes mind will chant very nicely
when you are sattvic, sometimes
when you are tamasic
mind will give material desires, sarajasik
some other thing xyz
so the position
of mind depends upon the modes of nature
so we should never depend upon the mind
it is very very dangerous
we should depend upon the scriptures
the standard rules and regulations given by Lord Krishna
even though we are feeling
like doing it in sattvaguna
we are not feeling like doing it in rajaguna and tamaguna
we should always try to
follow those instructions whether we feel like
following or not feel like following
otherwise if we listen our mind Saubhari Muni
tells in next shloka
then this will be example for future generations
for others to learn
how by association with
material enjoyment, listening to one's own
mind which follows the dictates
of three modes of nature, a person can lose
spiritual life, so that is why
never listen your mind
listen always to spiritual master
who repeats the instructions of Lord Krishna
but nevertheless
because Saubhari Muni was a yogi
spiritual life cannot be completely stopped
and although
it has to get
halted for few years
or few lifetimes
so Saubhari Muni was fortunate in the very same
lifetime after enjoying for many
many years a long tenure of
grahastha ashram
finally he got disgusted
and he went to jungle
and the wives of Saubhari Muni also
went along with Saubhari Muni because they were completely
dependent to the jungle
and then Saubhari Muni realizing his mistake
again continued the process of yoga
and at the time of death
because material desires were not there
he left his body and then he went
to spiritual world
and the wives of Saubhari Muni also
by the dint of
advancement of Saubhari Muni
although they were not very
powerful in performing yoga and spiritual
advancement they also reached the same
destination
so those people who are weak
so women are
generally considered not very powerful
for spiritual advancement
so that is why they depend upon their
husbands for spiritual advancement
material desires are more material
affection is very very more
so it is very very difficult but
somehow if this affection if
these desires can be dovetailed towards
the husband and that husband is very
advanced spiritualist
whatever is the destination of
husbands wife will follow automatically
simply by remaining
faithful to the husband
in a similar fashion Shri Prabhupada explains
if somebody is simply faithful
towards spiritual master
that person can be very weak and poor
in spiritual life
Prabhupada mentions if somebody has
very strong faith in the instructions of
Bhagavad Gita even though a person
is not able to follow the instructions
he will achieve liberation
so it is this faith which we have to attain
if a person is sincere he will become
Jeevan Mukta Sa Uchyate
Jeevan Mukta even while living in this
body he will experience transcendental
consciousness and he will be liberated
but if he is not so powerful
but he is very very faithfully discharging
the instructions of spiritual master
then he also will attain
perfect destination
so this is very important instruction that is why
Prabhupada tells chant 16 rounds and follow
four regulative principles and no
power in this world can stop you from going
back to godhead so if you faithfully
follow these instructions then
the liberation is assured
so that is why Bhakti Hoga is so
powerful
we all are weak now in Kalyugas
Sree Shudra Tatha Vaishya Sitae Pisi
Paapiyo Ne Yaha
Sree Vaishya Shudra they are not
very powerful for spiritual advancement
and in Kalyugas
there are these classes only there are women
there are Shudras
everyone is Shudra in Kalyuga
so that way all are less powerful
nobody is qualified so only
hope for us to advance in spiritual life is
remain very very faithful to
spiritual master and faithfully
discharge simple instructions
which he has given so just like the
wives of so never think I am not feeling
spiritual advancement even though
you will feel if you follow with determination
but somehow or the other
simply it does not matter what we are
feeling we are not feeling imperceptible
spiritual advancement we are making
simply by being faithful to
spiritual master
when Prabhupada was telling oh you have to be 100%
pure to go back to godhead
then he told okay 90%
80 70% I will take you
back then one disciple told
Prabhupada I think it is difficult for me even to have
70% purification
so Prabhupada told just hold my dhoti
I will take you back to godhead
means just remain faithful to me
so this is the secret of spiritual advancement
somehow or the other if a person
can develop small faith and that
faith can be developed by living in the association
of people who are similarly faithful
and if we discharge rules and regulations
very systematically
very very strictly we will come to
satvaguna and this faith will come
automatically by mercy of spiritual master
and this faith is sufficient
to deliver us
so we should be careful take care of all
these instructions don't commit vaishnava
what to speak of
physically verbally even mind
try to be very happy seeing
any vaishnava understand that
krishna is very merciful that is why he is able
to engage just like if you see
anybody working for a big company
so he has got the mercy of the manager
or the recruiter so in a similar
fashion nobody can engage
in krishna's service without receiving mercy
of krishna or pure devotee so
we should be very careful krishna's mercy has fallen
on this person let me not
develop any
ill feelings towards that person
so become very happy immediately
remember krishna whenever we see a
vaishnava so don't
commit a prad don't associate
thickly with the materialists
and try to be very faithful
to spiritual master these are some
very important learnings by which we can avoid
fall down and make our spiritual life perfect
so what is the answer of lord krishna
when arjuna is put forward this question
what will happen to yogi who does not complete
his life lord krishna very beautifully
explains we will see in the next class
so for now
we will end
the class here and practice
Hare Krishna Mahamantra before we
take up any questions so i request all
of you spines
can be kept erect this is a very simple
mantra Hare Krishna
Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama
Hare Hare entire spiritual perfection
protection from material contamination
happens by offenseless attentive
hearing of this mantra
so we will change
